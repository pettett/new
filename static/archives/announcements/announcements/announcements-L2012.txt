					<h1>19/06/2013: Oops</h1>
					
					<p>Well, that was interesting. Apologies for the complete failure to update throughout the second half of Lent and Easter; my life went somewhat downhill towards the end of Lent, and I spent most of the Easter holidays distracted by University Challenge and panicking about exams. But it's now officially my job to run the website, so hopefully I will be better at it next year. For now, though, I've updated the committee and TTBA pages with the latest information. Hopefully I will actually finish the redesign this summer.</p>
					
					<h1>16/02/2013: Week 5</h1>
					
					<h2>No meeting this Sunday</h2>
					
					<p>Disastrous news. This Sunday, remarkably many of our number have decided that watching terrible films is a better use of their time than going to CUSFS meetings. Furthermore, I don't have time either. In this complete breakdown of the chain of command I am left with no option but to call off the usual meeting tomorrow. Sorry about that!</p>
					
					<h2>Film night on Monday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>But, of course, the film nights go on. This Monday (19:30; we're in the Riley, meet outside Clare Old Court) we're watching Yeelen, a Malian film from 1987 - more information on the <a href="http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/images/filmtermcard-L2013.png">termcard.</a> Content warnings: apparently a chicken is actually burned to death on-camera, although this is at the very start of the film so hopefully it shouldn't be too difficult to avoid. It's worth mentioning that this isn't the most well-known film, though, so I can't guarantee the comprehensiveness of the IMDB content warnings list.</p>

					<h2>CUSFS lunches</h2>
					
					<p>I hear lunch on Friday was a success, so we are making it a weekly thing. I guess this is technically next week, but just to let everyone know it'll be happening again, Fridays at 2 in James' room.</p>
					
					<h2>AGM reminder</h2>
					
					<p>And finally, brief reminder that next Sunday is the AGM! So make sure to come along and exercise your democratic rights.</p>
					
					<h1>07/02/2013: Week 4</h1>
					
					<h2>Meeting this Sunday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>This Sunday's meeting (19:30 outside Sidney Sussex) will be on medieval settings in fantasy. Specifically: why is so much fantasy set in quasi-medieval Europe? Is there something special about it, or is it just tradition and eurocentrism? Does the setting of a fantasy series justify its content? How can fantasy subvert this trope, and what might it gain from doing so?</p>
					
					<h2>Film night on Monday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>The film night will be on Monday at 19:30 in the Riley Auditorium at Clare. We'll meet by the gate to Old Court like usual. The film will be Pan's Labyrinth - check the <a href="http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/images/filmtermcard-L2013.png">termcard.</a> for a description.</p>

					<p>Content warnings: okay, you know what, the precise nature of Pan's Labyrinth's creepiness is hard to describe, so I'll just link to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg.">imdb page.</a></p>
					
					<h2>AGM announcement</h2>
					
					<p>The AGM (Annual General Meeting; where the new committee are elected) will take place on the 24th of February at 19:30, in place of the regular meeting. Consider this the official two weeks' notice. Details as follows:</p>

					<p>Frederic Heath-Renn (fh291) will be the returning officer for the election of the committee. If you wish to run for a position, please e-mail him no later than 48 hours before the election. If you have any questions about the positions and what they do, feel free to e-mail the <a href="committee">current committee.</a></p>

					<p>I will be returning officer for the election of Vice Presidents. The electoral system has yet to be determined.</p>
					
					<h1>06/02/2013: Blade Runner screening tomorrow</h1>
					
					<p>Week 4 e-mail coming soon, but for now I'd like to let everyone know that St John's Picturehouse (in association with CUSFS) is showing Blade Runner tomorrow at 21:00. For those of us who rebelled at Will's tyranny in picking Close Encounters over Blade Runner last term (let's not let the fact that Blade Runner was released in the 80s get in the way of a good grudge), this is a good opportunity to see it. Tickets are 3.50 and more information is available <a href="http://www.stjohnspicturehouse.org.uk/findus.php">here</a>. Yes, I realise the website doesn't list it - but it IS on the termcard. I'm not sure what's up with that.</p>
					
					<p>Alas I am busy tomorrow, but I hope some of you can go along and nobly represent the society.</p>

					
					<h1>30/01/2013: Week 3</h1>
					
					<h2>Pre-announcement of Wake</h2>
					
					<p>This Saturday (the 2nd) shall see the Wake! This is an old and venerated Jomsborg tradition which can best be described as "we all stay up all night, then the Reeve does some stuff". This is the Reeve's territory, so I will let her explain in more detail in a later e-mail, but I wanted to mention it as soon as possible - sorry about the delay in the announcement, we've had some trouble finding a venue!</p>
					
					<h2>Meeting this Sunday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>Naturally, there shall be a normal meeting this Sunday, meeting in front of Sidney at 19:30 as always. Because we'll all be sleep-deprived, the topic shall be a light one, namely: your favourite books and authors! Having found myself often in the irritating situation in which far too few people have heard of the current book I am obsessed with, it occurs to me other people probably have the same feeling. So I thought it would be nice to have an official meeting in which we can go on and on about how great Obscure Book X is. (You could also go on and on about how great, I dunno, American Gods is. But the idea is to talk about books that others won't have necessarily heard of.) Then, we'll feel less like doing this at other times, therefore reducing the amount of off-topic chatter at future meetings! See, I have it all figured out.</p>
					
					<h2>Film night on Monday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>The film night this week (on Monday) will be in Will's room (K36 Queens'). We'll meet by the Queens' Lane gate at 19:30.  The film we're showing is Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. Check the <a href="http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/images/filmtermcard-L2013.png">termcard.</a> for more information. This is even longer than Stalker, so hopefully we can all be punctual so it doesn't end too late! Content warnings: dressing of (real, apparently) game animals; some violence; a fairly explicit sex scene.</p>
					
					<h1>24/01/2013: Week 2</h1>
					
					<h2>Meeting this Sunday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>We shall meet in front of Sidney, yet again, at 19:30. I say we, but I don't actually have time this weekend, so the meeting will be chaired by the Emergency Chairbeing Hologram (Binney). The theme is expanded universes. Are they actually any good? Do they add to the appeal of the original? And why does David Cameron want us to leave the EU?</p>

					<h2>Film night on Monday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>It's in my room, apparently, by some sort of unanimous decision. So we'll meet in front of Sainsbury's at 19:30. The film this week is Stalker - see the <a href="http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/images/filmtermcard-L2013.png">termcard.</a> for more information. Content warnings: nothing in particular, for once!</p>
					
					<h2>Constitution edited</h2>
					
					<p>The committee has made a few minor edits to the constitution, in order to bring it in line with current practice. If you're interested, you can see the new version <a href="constitution">here.</a></p>
					
					<h1>18/01/2013: Week 1</h1>
					
					<h2>Meeting this Sunday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>We remain faithful to Sidney, so we'll meet outside it as usual. The topic this week is time travel, because for some reason we don't seem to have talked about that in a while! How many different kinds of time travel plot are there? Do any of them make sense? Do any of them /actually/ make sense? Is any time travel film ever going to be better than Back to the Future? And what the hell was Primer all about, anyway?</p>

					<h2>Film night on Monday at 19:30</h2>
					
					<p>It's in the Riley Auditorium in Clare again, so we'll meet outside the gate to Old Court and walk from there. No snacks allowed while we're in the auditorium, remember.</p>
					
					<p>This week we're showing the Swedish film Let the Right One In (and not the American remake which, among other questionable decisions, changed the title to the incredibly banal Let Me In). More information can be found on the <a href="http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/images/filmtermcard-L2013.png">termcard.</a></p>

					<p>Content warnings: quite a lot of violence, generally nothing worse than might be expected from a vampire film, but there is one fairly graphic instance of (again) someone's face being melted off with acid; implied paedophilia; bullying; one split second instance of full frontal nudity, kind of; suicide, kind of.</p>

					<p>I only saw this film once, years ago, but it left enough of an impression on me that it was one of the few films I took with me when I moved to the UK, so I hope to see lots of you there!</p>
					
					<h1>04/01/2013: New Website: v0.5, or: version numbers beyond the decimal point are arbitrary</h1>
					
					<p>So, the new site has reached a state where I have decided that the Urgent Need for a site that <a href="old/index.html">dates to the current century</a> is more important than such considerations as an incomplete design and a thankfully non-finalised colour scheme.</p>
					
					<p>Here's how it's going to work. All relevant content from the old site is going to be moved here. The old site will remain on the server (link above, or under Archive on the menu) so that all its content remains accessible. Furthermore, we'll be updating the site regularly: the front page will contain the text of recent mailing list posts, and the events box will list all the upcoming events for the next week or two. I have high hopes that I will actually bother to update these. If I don't, kick me.</p>
					
					<p>So, bear with me. The content here is going to be a bit sparse for a while - if you really need to know who was MemSec in 2002, the old site will tell you. This version of the site is intended to provide basic day-to-day information, which has thus far been sadly lacking. Feel free to send me comments about it (fhd21), but keep that in mind. In particular, the design is nowhere near done, so I will largely ignore comments about that until it's finished. If you have ideas for things we should have on the site once it's up and running properly, though, I would be glad to hear from you.</p>
					
					<p>Right, I think that's all. I hope someone, somewhere finds this useful or I will be very sad.</p>
					
					<p>- Filip</p>

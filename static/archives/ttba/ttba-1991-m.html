Account</h2></a>

<h3>Robert Wilson and Gareth Rees</h3>

Thanks to the mind&#173;bogglingly enormous populatity of a certain
Mr. Pratchett, CUSFS are able to bring you a second large issue of
<cite>ttba</cite> this term.  The editors hope that the fifty people
who joined the society at the Terry Pratchett talk will discover that
although on the surface CUSFS appears to be full of long&#173;haired
beards who spend all their time drinking in New Hall bar on Thursday
evenings, underneath the facial hair we really love fantastic
literature in all its forms.  We hope that you will find inspiration,
wisdom, humour and only a minimum of complete rubbish in these pages;
that you will feel that your money has not been wasted, and that
perhaps, as the ancient mysticism of Christmas steals over your
holidays, you too will feel moved to write for us.<p>



<hr><a name="chairbei"><h2>The Chairbeing's Address</h2></a>
<h3>Philippa Hogben</h3>

Ah well, it's that time of the term again, when a Chairbeing has to do
what a Chairbeing has to do and what a Chairbeing has to do at this
time of the term is to write her address.  This term (as I write) is
nearly over and another term looms on the horizon with only the long
dark Christmas season in between... and of course the sweets trolley
and our fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs.<p>

First of all I must apologise for the non&#173;appearance of the last
issue of <cite>ttba</cite>... or rather the appearance of it at the
same time as this issue.  This is not <em>entirely</em> the fault of
the committee - somebody neglected to inform us that the Knox Shaw
Room (where the squash was held) was actually four dimensional. The
bag of magazines was taken to the squash for issuing to new members
but someone accidently dropped it and it fell through the fourth
dimension so we were unable to retrieve it.<p>

This term saw (at last) the 1990 "Sorry I Forgot" Christmas Party.  By
all accounts, this was a very lavish affair with hundreds of people
attending, excellent music, fun company and really wild things
happening.  Unfortunately, I had been banished to the cold wastes of
Glasgow for the weekend (where admittedly, I did get to ride on the
Glasgow underground) so I was not able to attend this
extravaganza. However, I am reliably informed that it was an event not
to have been missed with drink flowing like, er, wine, the band
playing as if inspired and the acts providing the entertainment were
actually <em>good</em>.  The best of all, and most realistic I am
told, was the impression done by the members of OUSFG of a wall.  Of
course, since I wasn't actually there, this could all be a load of
fetid dingos' kidneys but I (and those of you who didn't turn up) will
never know what did really happen.  There will be another chance to be
"in with the crowd" at the next Christmas Party to be held at around
Easter time next year.  More details will be circulated in due course
(like, for example, when they have actually been decided).<p>

While we are on the subject of next term I will just mention briefly
the CUSFS Annual Dinner. This has suddenly become traditional after
last year's success.  It will be held at the end of February - further
details to be decided later.  If you are interested, speak to the
Secretary.  If you want to go to the Dinner, also speak to the
Secretary (preferably after the start of next term).<p>

There is a light at the end of every tunnel.  However, the corollary
is that every light is hidden at the end of a dark, gloomy tunnel.
The bright lights of next term - that long distant time when you get
to come back at Cambridge to meet up with your friends again, to have
really wild parties and fun nights out... and to work your socks off
to keep from drowning under the workload which "they" try to cram into
a term so short you haven't time to blink - are therefore obscured by
the dark gloomy tunnel of the Christmas period.  While you are at home
celebrating with your family, therefore, spare a thought for the
discussions of next term.  The discussions will be decided at the Anne
McCaffrey discussion and will probably be announced sometime,
somewhere shortly after that.  If you can, then, please read one or
two books from the chosen authors over the festive season and turn up
next term to make an input to the discussions.<p>

The discussions tend to feature the same old authors because they are
the ones most people are likely to read.  Perhaps it is time to
introduce a new author.  As Chairbeing, I have one or two favourite
authors who I would like to see discussed.  Unfortunately, I am the
only person I know who has read one of these authors and only one of
two people (in Cambridge) I know who has read the other.  Under these
conditions we would end up with a monologue rather than a
discussion.<p>

The first of these authors is Christopher Hinz.  He has written a
series of books based on a being with one consciousness inhabiting two
bodies.  These beings are known as Paratwa with the two bodies known
as tways.  The three books in this series are <cite>Liege
Killer</cite>, <cite>The Paratwa</cite> and <cite>Ash Ock</cite>.  The
stories are set in a future in which the Earth is uninhabitable due to
pollution and the human race lives in Colonies - vast space stations
which orbit the Earth.  The paratwa are highly trained physically and
have very fast reflexes due to genetic engineering.  They were usually
employed as assassins in the recent past of the time of the story
(i.e. just before humanity had to abandon the Earth) but were thought
to have been wiped out when the Earth became uninhabitable.  The
people of the Colonies were, therefore, very rightly frightened of the
prospect of a paratwa loose in the Colonies - imagine being hunted by
something which can attack you from both sides at once with no need of
communication between the tways because they are as much part of the
same being as your left and right arms are part of you, which has
super fast reflexes and which is absolutely ruthless with regard to
its victim. Needless to say, at the start of the series a Paratwa
<em>is</em> loose in the colonies...  I found these books
<em>very</em> gripping and almost impossible to put down.  I am not
much of a critic (one of my English teachers once said of me, "She
reads for pleasure rather than analysis" which I think was supposed to
be a derogatory remark) so I will not analyse these books and their
characters in detail.  I will just say that I found it very easy to
identify with the main characters - Christopher Hinz made me
<em>want</em> to know what was going to happen to them.  The
characters are not all as straightforward as they seem.  I will not
say more.  Hopefully, the library will shortly possess a copy of this
series.  If there is sufficient interest we may have a discussion on
this next term, or in the third term when people are (or should be)
interested in revising and don't want to read a lot of books for a
discussion.<p>

The other author I would like to see discussed is James P. Hogan.  He
has written a series of three books - <cite>Inherit the Stars</cite>,
<cite>The Gentle Giants of Ganymede</cite> and <cite>Giant's
Star</cite> - and also some single books - <cite>Endgame
Enigma</cite>, <cite>The Proteus Operation</cite> and others.<p>

In the <cite>Giants</cite> series a spacesuited human body, several
thousand years old, is found on the moon.  The first two books are an
account of the scientific investigation of the body and other, er,
strange finds (I won't give too much away in case somebody out there
does want to read them).  The third book is more of a political
intrigue resulting from what the first two books uncovered.  Again,
the books are very well written - I read the first two books years ago
(borrowed from the library), wanted to read them again but had "lost"
them, tried to track them down (but I couldn't be sure I'd remembered
the title or author properly), eventually found them again and bought
and reread them and found that they were every bit as good as I
remembered.  The excitement of the discoveries is well conveyed
through the writing... but some of the science is a <em>little</em>
dodgy.  However, this does not detract from the stories.<p>

<cite>Endgame Enigma</cite> is about a Soviet space station to which
everybody thinks there is more than meets the eye.  Two Americans are
sent to investigate (disguised as journalists) and lo and behold they
uncover something (it is obvious that they would otherwise it would
have been a very short and boring story).  If you want to find out
what, read the book and try to work it out before it is revealed.
Although it is clear that <em>something</em> isn't right with the
Space station, it is by no means obvious what. It kept me guessing
until the end and I would recommend it to anybody.<p>

The other book of Hogan's that I have read is <cite>The Proteus
Operation</cite>. It starts off in a world where Hilter won the Second
World War and then proceeded to take over the rest of the world. At
the start of the story (around about the 2000 A.D. mark - I can't
remember exactly) only the U.S.A. is holding out against the Third
Reich. A group of scientists is sent back in time to prevent Hitler
winning WWII and discover that somebody else (from a different future)
is helping Hitler's forces.  They also discover it is impossible to
change your own past.  This book is definitely one to read and
re&#173;read.<p>

If anybody is interested in hearing anything more about these books
(Hinz or Hogan) I will be pleased to tell them, or lend them my
copies.  I would recommend that people read any (or all) of them over
the Christmas holiday. I would also like a discussion on one or both
of these authors - and will suggest one if there is sufficient
interest.<p>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

When I was young I became very interested in history, or at least in
what I perceived as being history, which chiefly involved an
uncritical study of the videosophies and books my father had retained
from his time at Placenda.  He too had had an interest in and studied
medieval history, and perhaps it was the case that my attentions arose
from a desire to be like him.  To tell the truth, what I discovered
gradually came to appall me.  That period of our past is netted with
disasters like a scab over perished skin.  The tolls of misery and
mass death were fascinating but horrifying: plague, war, crusade,
invasion - these were the lot of a morass of humanity who even under
the best of circumstances spent their lives in toil and despair.  It
was impossible for me to imagine what life must have meant to, for
example, the victims of the Children's Crusade; indeed it was almost
inconceivable that these past dead people could have had any suffering
in their terrible failure at all.  The crowds were too great to
visualise as individuals with individual egocentric sight and
individual tragedies.  I had a view of the humanity of history as a
vast grey cloud; and each man, woman and child was nothing more than a
drop of water vapour within that cloud - agitated, individual,
insensible, identical.  And when disaster came the cloud was riven and
precipitated to flat rain which fell to disappear in the earth below,
a nothing.  I drew comfort from the security of my own warm and
colourful home, stable in an age when disaster had been vanished, but
when I compared my own comfort with the lot of a past and primitive
peasantry, the inequality did not seem fair.<p>


<b>23 Feptembruar, Nachteen, Octrian</b><p>

It has been three days since they exploded the charm bomb
off&#173;planet.  They waited til their own ships were free of orbit
and then detonated - now our fleet has been neutralised they can do
roughly what they like in space.  As the sun side shifted the whole of
the planet was irradiated, even the Peace Squads in the arctic
bunkers.  The effects are noticeable already.<p>

I hate my wife.<p>

I watched her get up this morning.  I lay in bed later than usual and
followed her with my eyes as she got ready for the day.  I'm amazed
that I could have been married to her for three years in an apparently
perfect semblance of happiness when it is quite obvious that we are
basically unsuited to each other.  It's not that she isn't pretty,
because she is - peculiarly, now that her attraction for me has
vanished I only realised this properly for the first time in perhaps
two years.  If it was simply a matter of looking at her as an ornament
I would be content, but as it is there is no question of a
relationship between two such badly matched egos - the abrasions close
proximity entails with its petty intrusions and frictions would be too
great.  I cannot stand the woman, now all her winning ways have left
her. It is obvious that she feels much the same about me.  She watched
me looking at her from the bed while she put on her skirt until she
burst out,<p>

"For God's sake stop watching me and do something, you're so bone
idle.  It's not as if you didn't snore enough last night while I
didn't get a wink of sleep as usual.  You know, I've wanted to tell
you this for a long time - you know you plonk yourself into the middle
of the bed at night and leave me to fend with the edges?  I have to
sleep round you, you're almost forcing me out of the bed.  It's very
difficult to get any rest at all."<p>

I turned round on my front, so I wouldn't have to see her reproach me
for lying there.  It's none of her business when I get out of bed,
I'll get up when I'm ready, when I feel like it.  Work's not for
almost an hour yet.<p>

She really makes me cross sometimes, that woman.  She just tells you
to do things, as if she had a perfect right - I do not have to follow
her orders.  I didn't mind so much when she used to smile for me - I
used to feel thrilled when I could please her.  But since the charm
bomb dropped I've had nothing but pursed mouths from her, and I've
noticed more her occasional habit of looking sideways at you with the
corners of her mouth turned down - a look of evaluation, as if she
were weighing you for an idiot, and judging the value of her future on
that score.  She does it in quiet moments and to be honest it really
gets me down.<p>

Also there's her habit of telling you something quite obvious and
expecting you not to know.  I give up.  a man can't go on giving and
giving himself forever, he wants some acknowledgement once in a while,
a promise that he is winning a return respect on his affections - not
orders, snide looks and scorn, scorn, scorn.  My wife has been selfish
with me for too long, I am resolved to leave her.  It's obvious one of
us has to get out.<p>

We breakfasted in silence.  She cuts the crusts off her toast before
she eats it and piles them on the side of the plate, a stupidly
pointless habit which is beginning to irritate me.  I could name
dozens.<p>

Work was no better.  My boss is another woman whom I've had to put up
with too long.  She's older than me, coarse and heavy, and sarcastic.
When I came in this morning she said, "Late again, eh, Rodriguez?"  I
was five minutes early, as she could see perfectly well by the office
clock.  "If this goes on we'll have to stop your pay."  And then she
gave a loud flat laugh and stared at me as if to challenge me to an
answering joke.  I couldn't hear any humour in it, and her mouth
remained flat as the desk.  All morning as I was trying to work she
kept on interrupting me, passing comments or making pointless
interjections which there was no benefit in acknowledging.  I don't
see why I should grudge her a smile, and I can make my own opinions
about the world without her randomly pointing out its absurdities.  I
got back at her in the lunch break by sitting absolutely silent, and
scowling stolidly at her when I finished my cheese roll.<p>

We used to get on really well, and the hours passed pleasantly enough.
I once even asked her back for dinner.  She had a lively tongue behind
her flat face, and used to amuse me by being far ruder than she should
about her own superiors, about various bugbear politicians, about our
status in the Settlements.  Even now I'll still admit that she's a
very intelligent woman (an intelligence which nowadays I can feel her
turning on me, doubtless to my detriment).  But the ease of her
language has gone, and her good humour which made it bearable, and the
hundred little snide flicks of the eye and turns of the nose and droll
smiles which gave life and irony to her conversation.  Then you could
tell she meant less than she said.  But to be honest, there's nothing
really very clever to being rude about people, even in ways which they
patently deserve, and when it goes on and on it ceases to be merely
unnecessary and becomes downright malicious.  My work is difficult
enough to bear without it.<p>

As the war has turned against us, the facts which I have to administer
at work become more and more depressing.  At least this isn't the
fault of the charm bomb - but while everyone around me was still
prepared to make an effort, while we were actively working
<em>with</em> each other, it was much easier to endure.  There was a
certain comradeship in adversity, as assumption that if we all tried
to pull together - and we did, we did - then we might be able to drag
out a victory.  This has all changed, and no one seems to give
tuppence.  Believe me, I would try so hard to do my bit to see us
through if I only felt that the rest of the population would do the
same, but now that I've had the chance to see how disagreeable they
are, I don't doubt that most of our planet's people are motivated
purely by selfish concerns.  It's doubtless the same on Earth, but
their selfishness has driven them together against us.<p>

I work in the civil service, in Munitions and Supply.  I'm fit enough
to fight, but the number of spacemen we deploy is limited not by the
number we can raise but rather by the number of ships we can get into
space.  There's none left on planet now and our factories have mostly
been bombed with vibrators - it's emotionally impossible for anyone to
enter them without heavy futility shielding.  I'm in Weapons
Coordinations anyhow.  If we can get the materials together we can
still construct large on&#173;planet emplacements.  We need something
fast, since it's obvious to everyone that invasion can be only a few
days away.  Our great weapon is the Green Weasel Karma gun; it's
effective, but it has its limitations.  We had some success at the
start of the war when we penetrated their shielding to devolutionise
the crews of several large battleships into low karmic forms, entities
far enough down the scale of enlightenment as to be unable to fulfil
their own functions.  Lacking knowledge of the gun's principles, the
Terrans will almost certainly be unable to rehabilitate or
re&#173;evolve such karmic casualties.  But when we came to experiment
with the gun's theoretical second facility, that of transferring the
stolen karma to our own troopers, we hit problems: undeservedly
passing on or `fencing' karma was such a low karma thing to do that
for every karmic receiver who was transformed into a superman for our
side, the weapon's operator - sensitised by proximity to the gun -
would himself suffer karma loss and devolve, to apeman status or
worse.  There is nothing to be done with a gun's battery but store it
out of the way where there's no danger of contamination - but even the
best sealed battery permits a small leak, and there are rumours of the
used karma&#173;filled weapons slowly evolving into higher grades of
gun.  If this is true, we can only hope it will happen fast enough for
them to be of some use to the war.<p>

I shuffled figures around all day, keeping track of what the military
had done.  When I went home, my boss called out behind, "Had enough,
eh, Rodriguez, can't take the pace in the sweat box?"  There was more
aggression than usual there; I'm sure she was trying to actually bully
me into a response.  I refuse to give in to this sort of verbal
combat.  As a catcall it was worthless anyway: it was properly my
knocking&#173;off time, and she'd be leaving in five minutes herself.
I don't know what she was trying to prove, but it made me angry all
the way home.  Everyone was giving each other shifty looks on the
monorail.  There was no comfort from my wife.  The dedicated creature
hadn't done a stroke of work around the house, she "didn't see why she
should lift a finger for a man who never does anything for her."  The
days are well past when I took a certain pride and comfort in being
able to tolerate her laziness.  She'd spent all day cutting up
magazines with scissors to make ugly collages.  It's good to see we've
all got our parts to play in the war effort, eh?  Not that I saw any
point in telling her so.  I just didn't say a word, I'm not going to
be the one who provokes the arguments.  I'd go out, but there's no
point, there's nothing to do and none of my friends live in Mantarda.
But now I come to think of it, they were mostly stupid people
anyway.<p>


<b>24 Feptembruar, Nachteen, Octrian</b><p>

The government newspaper came out today, so I paid my 20 pistoleros
and got a copy.  No mention of how badly the war was going; instead,
all over the front page:

<blockquote>PLAGUE OF SUICIDES<br>

THIS HAS BECOME A WAR OF BLOOD</blockquote>

Further on down I saw: `How can the people of Earth countenance their
conduct?  Don't they know that they have become murderers?  We must
redouble our efforts, we must not let the Terrans win a dirty
victory.'  Elsewhere in the paper the government Minister for Morals
issued a thoroughgoing attack on the Earth tactics and several tracts
demagoguically urging us to stick together.  The essence of the story
was that the charm bomb fallout was causing large numbers of people to
commit suicide when they found their lives had suddenly become
unendurable.  Apparently, while I had been at work yesterday the body
count had been huge: most of the suicides fairly public, mostly men,
mostly in the mid&#173;afternoon.  To read the article, the pavements
below tall buildings were becoming awkward places to stand.  And from
these circumstances the paper drew a fine moral indignation: that
Earth was responsible for these deaths by the use of killer weaponry,
that she had broken all the bounds of diplomacy, signed treaty and
indeed morality, that she had succumbed to her ancient grasping agony
in reverting to the bloodthirsty wars of past barbarian eras.  What
tripe!  What rubbish!  What use to castigate the people of Earth or to
appeal to their better natures when the people of Earth do not receive
`Los Corridos' and will never read the arguments which it shouts out
on every page?  War is war, let's face it, and we'd do the same to
them.  War is battle and there's nothing to be done, and we know the
state of this war and there's little our minister for morals can say
about that!  It's nothing but journalistic swank.  It's another sign
that society is going to the dogs.  The tension in the street is easy
to feel - not that there are many people about, since it's wartime and
everyone has their business, but I find myself increasingly irked by
the simple annoyance of humanity: one man will have the violent
sniffles, another a palpably low standard of personal hygiene and so
on across the limited bustle.  It's incredible to me that people don't
have the basic decency to recognise and correct their little habits
that make them so annoying.  For a fact, the Government administration
pool is entirely staffed by clerks and underlings who pick elastic
matter from between their teeth to flick at people, vast insalubrious
crowds of them.  Pedro's such an unreasonable rotter! and I just used
not to notice.  What he has against me I don't know.  I've had to give
up conversing with him.<p>

When I got back to the house in the evening I broke a rule and
switched on the television.  Annibal fat&#173;arse de Ammartino was
explaining emergency social procedure in case of invasion.  We can all
do our bit by making ourselves over to surprise governmental orders,
he says.  What a sweaty greaseball!  He sat and revved his mouth at
the screen, it's plain that from the start he's done nothing but issue
pronunciamentoes so we'll notice him.  How we ever elected him in the
first place I'll never know.  The top button of his shirt was undone
under his tie.  It's obvious he'll never last another election.<p>

I'm still thinking as if there'll be another election.<p>

I have used my influence as a government administrator to get myself
an ego&#173;pistol.  It's for self&#173;defence against the
possibility of invasion.  If Earth troops land and come at me there's
a chance I'll be able to inflate the egos of enough to put them off
from risking their necks in somebody else's contest - perhaps I'll
then be able to get away.  It's a shame I could only get an
ego&#173;pistol; I was hoping for something I could use on my wife if
she pushes me any further: solve our problems once and for all.  But
the gun would be useless on her, her ego's big enough as it is.<p>

One thought was in my mind all evening: invasion.  What
terror&#173;weapon are the Earthmen going to launch against us?  More
bombs?<p>


<b>St Anna's day, 1st Dirzi, Nachteen, Octrian</b><p>

When I woke up this morning, I found my wife had left me.  So, now for
good and all, that's the last thing at which I have failed: I saw I
could not have it in me to make another person happy.  We had had a
blazing row when we both found ourselves awake at one o'clock in the
morning.  It started as a natural consequence, because each was so
exasperated with the other we were looking for the slightest
lee&#173;way in each other's behaviour to lay on a mountain of
recrimination and hate.  Hate?  I suppose it came to that.  She
accused me of coldness, I retaliated by claiming her as arbitrary and
we wore ourselves out with shouting.  In the morning I found she
simply wasn't there any more.  I am miserable, yet flatly miserable as
if I'd wasted a rainy day.  It is curiously dull to see yourself as a
human untouchable, a social failure, a solitary.  I have to have
something solid in my life!<p>

I would die rather than seek comfort from my boss, and let's face it,
there was nowhere else I could go.  The world has nothing for me; very
well, I shall have nothing for the world, it will only see my mask.<p>

Where can I bleed out my passion now?<p>

I would have found it tolerable to remain at home for the first time
since the bomb; I would have exercised myself on those possessions of
my wife which she left behind.  I thought of smashing something as a
personal demonstration.  Where were my fine reserves of spite and
malice?  Where was the true turn of the love that had failed?  I knew
I could arouse it!  But it was wartime, and I had to work even on
holidays.  When I left the house I walked quickly, to keep myself
dull.  It was better.  I looked at the well&#173;known houses as I
went by - how slowly we stride, men - and saw them as if for the first
time.  What went by behind <em>their</em> fronts?  Nothing to match
me!<p>

How dare she! I thought on the monorail.  I stared round at the other
passengers.  They were all stupid clods, with jelly eyes.  I could
hate humanity.  Perhaps the Earthmen should just kill us all.<p>

How dare she! I thought at work.  I loved her!  I did once, I trapped
myself in a self&#173;deceit, an idealisation of this inferior,
incomprehending character in the hope of some access to a joy all my
reading had led me to theorise could exist.  But to maintain that joy
in marriage over such a period of time...  It would have been all
right if she had not been so basically irritating!  Couldn't she see
her own faults?  I found an access to my hidden passion.  All morning
I simmered away, working faster and faster, shuffling my papers,
pounding my keys in increasing violence to make mistake after mistake
til lunch.  I couldn't eat.  `There's a purity in work,' I told
myself, and didn't look at my boss.  I could feel in my skin she
wanted to hear the story, and she'd be a fool if she hadn't guessed.
I analysed tables and drew up statistics and made ploys to shepherd
the world's resources.  How dare she!  What right did she have to do
this to me?  She was in the wrong!  Her slights, her ingratitude, her
laziness, her insensitivity - I had a multitude of examples I longed
to answer for to her face - all combined to wound me to the heart for
her action.  This woman I had set up to love!  And I had intended to
leave her!  It was to have been my right, I was the one to make
decisions, for once just for once it would have been me me me!  Me to
take the action!  Me to demonstrate my power to her!  I didn't have to
cushion her slights, I had the force of love.  And she had devastated
me with the final weapon which I wanted to use.  Christ!  She had
prepared for it for years, that was obvious, jabbing and crushing a
path into me with scorn and indolence, making way for the final proof
of my impotence.  I banged my fists on the table.  I didn't scream.
These papers, this work, what was it to me?  My lifesblood, that's
what, not just paper printout, it was what I fed my mind on, the
progress of the war.  I exercised my will against it, watching the ebb
and flow of statistics as they washed out their results, casting up
the facts of our progress, and it was my work on those facts, my
theories, my plans and recommendations, honest, which dictated the
course of strategy, mens' lives, our success in war.  The tide was
against us, we had lost.  I had failed yet again, and had to watch my
failure as the resources dwindled and ground me down.  I worked so
hard!  I put in all my effort and failed, failed, failed, impotent
despite my sacred best which flailed in powerlessness against the
great facts of insufficiency, destruction, failure.  There was
nothing!  I had no success in war or wife!  The world was horrible,
its people ghastly, true true, I had nothing in my life, nothing in my
core, I had worked for years and years and achieved a state of
nothing.  I was the failure.  I was the death.  I was unique in a dead
world with people who did not deserve.  Terra oppressed.  What were my
options?  I swept my coffee cup from the table.  I leapt to my feet,
my chair catapulted out from behind.  My boss had been startled when I
banged my fists; appalled at my display she sat and watched me pant at
her.  What a bovine, murderous, brutish woman!  At this moment, the
invasion alarm went off.<p>

It screamed like a bagful of orphans being whipped with chains.  We
both looked towards the ceiling, which was foolish as there was
nothing to see.  This was the end, and we were two administrators in
an office.  I ran to the door and dashed out.<p>

The observation post!  On the roof!  If there was a threat, I could
see it from there.<p>

The lift hadn't worked since power had once been briefly diverted
during a fire near the Houses of Government.  I leapt for the
stairwell and clattered up it, two and three at a time until a heavy
object knocked me aside as it thumped its own way down.  It was the
peace guard from the roof observation post.  I looked after him and
for an instant he glanced back, his face like a stone cliff glowing
with hidden blood.  His mouth gaped and then he was gone, spooked away
on his urgent destiny.  What impelled him?  I ran up the stairs again
to see for myself.<p>

The emergency exit to the roof was open and the man's post empty.
There was nothing in the sky.  There was no sound.  This wasn't what I
wanted: I seized the magniscope and focussed it where the man had
swung it free in his panic.  I looked around.  Nothing.  Across the
city, was that a black dart I saw shoot from the sky to lose itself
among low skyscrapers?  Nothing.  If this was an invasion, I told
myself, it seemed to be one of invisible and rather harmless men.  And
then I saw Him.<p>

I had swung the scope low to search the streets.  They were empty, til
I caught a running man, and then another, and then a score of people,
all ages, all speeds, running for all they were worth in the same
direction.  My scope outpaced them all.  Scatters became a knot, a
smut, a choke, a pressing heaving crowd of humanflesh in the
constricting streets all forcing towards one point, a point risen to
with increasing frenzy, urgency, with clawing and - I could see their
mouths move - screaming human beings, packed too tight now for
violence, gasping, abandoned, trying in agony to climb upon one
another, all reaching up for the same thing, all urgent for a part of,
for the notice of one man, the man at the apex of the point, the who,
the what?  He was a shadow, then a presence, then in my eager eyes
like a burst of light, he was the man, the man who swung low over the
cloud on an antigravity surfboard with flashy jet nozzles, the prime
dominant figure in the glittering blue spandex, his laser gun swung
low at the hip, the stupid little plastic fins attached to his ankles
and helmet glinting in the frosty light; he was the one, the only, the
invasion from Earth - oh God, he was Beautiful.  How can I describe a
young god?  His face in its mock&#173;Greek Space Marine's Combat
Helmet was a chiselled statue turned to the light, acknowledging with
grace and ease the plaudits of the crowd.  One hand was waved in
casual lethargy to the multitude, the sequined sleeve just falling
half away to reveal a wrist and forearm of such clarity and firmness
it took my breath away.  His muscles breathed beneath his skintight
jetsuit like the slow pulsing of an oiled machine, his poise was the
perfect assurance of the perfect man.  I would have died for the way
he balanced his laser rifle over his shoulders with his other arm,
thought intellectually I realised it was probably a plastic model with
flashing red lights stuck to the side.  His body was lithe and true.
The man was the epitome of charm and grace, of wit and rightness and
style, the one true thing - I could tell at a glance - in a world
which had proved itself a woe, and I wanted to fuck him there and
then, I wanted to fuck him now, I wanted to clear away all the other
vagabonds from round his feet and worship him alone.  The peace guard!
My boss!  They mustn't meet him!  He was too fine a god to meet them,
he was too charming to be wasted out on anyone but me!  I broke eye
contact with the scope, I turned and ran to the stairwell.  I went
down into my street to force my way into the crowd to welcome the
Starship Sextrooper.<p>

Excert from an editorial in `The Manchester International Echo', most
widely&#173;read newspaper on planet Earth:

<blockquote>"... a remarkable victory.  Just three platoons of this
innovative weapons system, unassisted, were able on several swoops to
effect the surrender of Mantarda and provinces in the vicinity proved
themselves willing to be subdued.  A government official... has
suggested that the whole planet may be reduced within three weeks.  In
sum, we may congratulate ourselves that the whole campaign is a
tribute to the spirit of self&#173;denial, ingenuity and humanity
which has always characterised the exploits of Terra.  Never has a war
been so cleanly or kindly won!  Never has battle been so humanitarian!
Truly the apex of civilisation is now..."  (continues for three

<hr><a name="worldbui"><h2>World&#173;Building in SF and
Fantasy</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Arrowsmith</h3>

The whole essence of fiction, some would argue, is to produce a
believable, but imaginary setting.  This, even more so, is the problem
set before sf writers - in most cases, they have to build a plausible
universe from scratch.  Yes, they can lean on, borrow from, our own
world (although less so for fantasy), but they will ultimately be
judged on, alongside literary merit, how convincing their `otherness'
is.<p>

Tolkien will always be described as the master of world&#173;building.
However, he was able to devote a lifetime's work into the creation of
Middle Earth, a vast amount of time and effort, in fact, when compared
with the actual literary return.  A modern author cannot afford to do
this; not, at least, if they want to make a living from it.  Yet the
fantasy authors, at least, will have their work compared with
Tolkien's, and they must come up with a few tricks if they do not want
the comparison to be too unfavourable.<p>

Many authors seem to suffer the delusion that their creation will
appear more realistic if they carefully explain every nuance of its
functioning.  Unless they have produced a background on a truly
enormous scale, as Tolkien did, then this will, in fact, have the
reverse effect.  Reality does not work like that - we do not know
everything, know every place and every character.  Reality has loose
ends, and so must fiction if it is to be remotely convincing.  Tolkien
knew this, and left many aspects he had worked out unstated, and the
work is all the more convincing for it.  An author in the present day
must indicate that something exists beyond the edges of their writing,
even if they themselves do not know what it is.  Guy Gavriel Kay
appears to have been successful in this way in <cite>Tigana</cite>,
whereas he rather failed at it in <cite>The Fionavar Tapestry</cite>.
The sign of an improving author, perhaps?  The same cannot be said of
Stephen Donaldson's fantasy - which stands alongside Kay's as modern
popular classics of the genre - which in fact appears to get worse
from the point of view of over&#173;explanation as the three series
unfold.  In the field of sf, Robert Silverberg pulls the trick quite
beautifully in a number of books - for instance, <cite>A Time of
Changes</cite>, which describes the interaction between a
planet&#173;bound people and off&#173;worlders without once saying
anything about what the actual off&#173;world situation is.  Brian
Aldiss's Helliconia is another fine example of a totally plausible
world; although, strangely, his portrayal of Earth is less convincing
than that of Helliconia, to my mind, at least.<p>

It is also tempting to put Frank Herbert's <cite>Dune</cite> series
alongside these, but, on consideration, Arrakis itself is not very
believable as a planet.  It suffers, along with many fantasy worlds
and the vast majority of sf planets, from being far to uniform over
its surface.  Think of the variety of climates and habitats on Earth,
and compare it to the sci&#173;fi clich&eacute;s of Desert Planets and
Ice Planets.  Yes, if you have a planet with that sort of climactic
extreme, it may well be all hot or all cold to a human, but it is
still going to exhibit a great deal of variation over its surface.
Far too few authors take this into account.<p>

Even if the world itself is believable, the (human) society on it must
still be viable for it to be convincing.  An sf author can
conveniently claim "trade with other planets", but this ducks the
issue rather, unless they consider what other aspects of such a trade
network might be.  A fantasy world must be self contained, and all too
often an author will carefully describe a world which cannot possibly
sustain itself - it being far to tight and constricted.  Donaldson's
Land is a prime example of this; another, far worse, is Mike Jeffries'
first trilogy, which appears to be set in a world which consists of
five locations and the roads between them, and where half the
population are soldiers.  Quite how the economics of such a place work
is unclear.<p>

The author must, therefore, be very careful as to what is said, what
is left unsaid, and what is hinted at.  There is little point in a
fantasy writer giving a carefully detailed explanation of the workings
of magic in a particular world if it has no relevance to the main
character - it would be far more convincing as an unexplained force.
On the other hand, the impact of such magic on the society it exists
in must also be considered if a plausible whole is to be generated.
An sf author may wish to include a cunningly designed bit of ecosystem
on a planet.  Not only must it be consistent and workable, but the
author must also be carefully not to give the impression that this is
all there is - a set up that can be easily described in its totality
in a novel is going to be too simple to be realistic.  The world, the
universe, is far to complicated a place for any author to create
another.  Fiction is like a window into these alternate realities -
and the author must make sure not only that what we see is convincing,
but also that we are aware that the frames are the edges of the tale,
not the edges of the universe.<p>

<hr><a name="apicture"><h2>A Picture of the Shattered Land</h2></a>

<h3>Matthew Reid</h3>

For once the newsboard had only good news. Large at the top was

<blockquote>Over 50% of Births Normal<p>

The revised figures for the last month show 51.2% of births were
classified as normal by the board of inspectors. This is a 2 point
improvement over last months record figures. The head of the board of
inspectors said "This is very good news. The figures are showing
steady improvement, and now this important milestone has been passed,
we can only look towards greater improvements in the months to
come."</blockquote>

He stopped reading, a quick glance at the headlines had told him that
all the rest of the news was the normal pep talk, another few stories
built on the top of the apartment blocks, a few hundred more people to
be housed. He got into the lift and headed down to his work. When he
arrived, he found an invitation on his computer. "David and Sasha
cordially invite you to a house warming, and over half normal
party. Arrive 7.00 for 7.30 dinner. Formal dress."<p>

He mailed his acceptance, and got to work. It was a quiet day, mostly
controlling a remote on the endless task of overhauling the reactor
that produced two thirds of the community's power.<p>

When he returned home, he found a card copy of the invite. Very flash,
he thought, and, after changing, set off to the party. It was up, a
long way up, in one of the newest blocks of apartments. He had never
been that high before.  On arriving, he rang the doorbell. His hostess
let him in. Most of the people there he recognized, at least from
other parties, but there was one completely new face.<p>

"If you would allow me to introduce you", said Sasha, leading him
towards the stranger, "Peter, this is Joshua, Joshua this is
Peter. Joshua is an artist. We commissioned a painting from him
specially for the new apartment. He is very exclusive, only works when
he feels the setting is right. This painting can't be moved from the
apartment."<p>

"I feel very strongly that the ambience makes, or breaks, a piece of
art. I do not even allow them to repaint the walls without consulting
me first. If you like, I will show it to you."<p>

"Delighted."<p>

Peter was led into another room. The walls were white, with many
paintings on them, representing a small fortune just in the canvas,
leaving alone the waste of space.<p>

On the wall opposite the door was the picture. It was large, about one
and a half meters by a meter, and it depicted a shattered, dead
landscape, as seen through very thick glass. Dust and ashes seemed to
stir, no did stir, as if in a faint breeze. Beyond was a vista of grey
ash, and grey snow, and grey clouds, backing up into the horizon. On
the simple iron grey frame, written in neat black letters was `A
Window onto the Shattered Land.'<p>

Peter felt a shiver run down his spine. It was strangely horrible
picture.  "It's very disturbing, very good. How did you manage the
effect?"<p>

"Holography. A unit is embedded in the wall. The sequence takes a
month to make its grand cycle, while random factors ensure that each
repetition is slightly different. This is my first landscape using the
technique, I normally do pictures of machinery, tubes, cables and
rock, but I immediately saw that for this place, I was ready to face
the challenge of a full blown landscape. The problems of getting
realistic dust flurries are immense, but I view my greatest success to
be in the storms. They don't come up very often, but to see one is an
experience. As well as the actual projector, there is a large
computer, dedicated to the production of the image, which is also
embedded in the wall."<p>

At that point Sasha entered. "Come on Joshua, there are other people
who want to talk to you."<p>

They left Peter alone in the room, staring at the picture, for a
timeless five minutes, before he headed out to join the party.<p>

He quickly fell into the comfortable routine of meeting old
acquaintances, hearing all the new gossip. He was one of the friends,
who had mostly arrived early, and he quietened down when the
influential guests started to arrive.  David was an executive, only a
few ranks down from the top of the Geothermal Energy Resources Unit,
who produced all the electricity that the reactor did not. Sasha was
second from the top of information dispersal, one of the people who
knew what was actually happening, not just the censored version. The
people who were arriving then were all of similar influence, and Peter
was quite grateful when the call came for dinner.<p>

The first course was pleasant enough, and the white wine superb, maybe
even made from grapes, but the main meal shocked Peter. Meat, real
meat, from a cow, with the fat, and bones. The cost of meat from
animals was huge, astronomical, as space was at a premium, and as
feeding animals was such a waste of plant biomass. Peter had eaten a
few vegetables, on special occasions, but mostly he lived, as did most
of the population, on the product of the yeast and algal tanks.<p>

At the end of the meal, after the traditional toast to the stars and
stripes, the party moved back into the outer room. Like most of the
others he was drunk, but he was still in control enough to just fade
into the background, and to not embarrass himself.<p>

He wandered back into the room with the picture, and contemplated its
slight movements. His concentration was broken by the sounds of an
argument from inside.<p>

"Why will you not do me a picture? I am willing to pay twice, three
times what these have paid. Just name a sum."<p>

"I am sorry. I surveyed your apartment, and it is just not suitable
for one of my works. I am an artist, and not to be bribed. I am hardly
starving now am I?"<p>

"If you refuse, I shall take it as a personal insult. I will have a
Joshua Quail picture."<p>

"If you want a Joshua Quail, you must change apartment. The whole
atmosphere in your room is wrong."<p>

"I will give you an entire room to work with. You can make it look
just like this room. I will give you a free hand. You can create the
atmosphere, but you must let me buy a picture."<p>

"Philistine. It is not just a matter of paint and plaster, it is
atmosphere. It takes me at least six months to do a picture, and if I
am not happy with the setting, then I will be unhappy about the
picture. I refuse to waste six months of my life for anyone, including
you. I say again, if you want a picture of mine, you must move. I will
look for a place I feel happy to accept a commission for, and then let
you veto my choice. I create my pictures to go with places, and will
allow you first refusal at the place with my next picture."<p>

"I live in my rooms, and will not move for some prideful artist. I
hope you realise who you are refusing this favour to. I am the head of
the police. If you refuse, I will hound you. You will be observed
every second of every minute of every day until you give in. If you so
much as break the most petty statute, even on a mere technicality, I
will call a court marshal on you. Think about it, and contact me
within the week."<p>

Peter heard the slamming of a door, and then shocked silence. He
rejoined the crowd, but the mood was broken, and like most of the
others he soon gave his apologies, and left. He could not cope with
the highest echelons. All descended from the politicians and the
military whose incompetence had forced them down here in the first
place. Treat some African states as shit for just a bit too long, keep
on thinking you're a superpower, and forget the great leveller. It
evened off the sides all right, radiation so high that only a few
insects and hardy plants had survived and still they called it a
victory because we had these bunkers built, so a few of us
survived. They didn't even have the decency to declare an end to the
war. They said there was still a possibility of an attack from enemy
bunkers or humans who had survived on the surface. It was just an
excuse to stop those in power losing it. There may just have been a
poor sick humanoid or two, in a sheltered valley somewhere, but
no&#173;one who could think of attacking. When he got back to his
room, Peter opened up his bottle of algae wine, and swigged it down at
a great rate, ignoring the taste of synthetic grape flavouring. It was
alcohol, and right now all he wanted was to slide down into the
oblivion that alcohol offered.<p>

He woke with a headache, and called in ill. By the afternoon he
realised that he really was ill, still vomiting frequently. He
staggered to the lift, and then along to the doctor, who told him that
his system was probably just unable to cope with animal protein, and
gave him a few pills and potions.<p>

He felt well enough to go back to work the next day, but he wasn't
going to waste the excuse, so he sat down in front of his terminal and
loaded up a book.  He found it difficult to concentrate, his mind kept
slipping back to the party, and the picture. He sent messages to
various friends, suggesting they meet up after work. He did not dare
ask them what they knew directly over the computer, as he knew how
closely that could be monitored, and he guessed that those directly
concerned would not be happy to see him spreading gossip about
them.<p>

Things like that didn't happen at the parties of high ups, or at least
not if you were talking to the low&#173;lifes, the genetic resource
bank, the mass of people whose sole job was to have sufficient babies
to keep the system ticking over. Of course to have access to a
computer meant that his friends were employed, and so at least that
one huge step above the masses, but you still didn't say anything that
put an executive down, at least not in public.<p>

They met in a local recreation area, all pooling together to rent the
small, empty room for a few hours. Peter's news was greeted with great
interest, this was their favourite kind of gossip, but much to Peter's
disappointment no&#173;one there could add anything.<p>

It was not until two weeks later that he did find out anything new. He
was sitting at his work terminal when he received a message from David
asking him to come round immediately after work. He left ten minutes
early, and hurried to the lifts. When he arrived, David answered his
knock. "What do you want me for?" asked Peter.<p>

"I've got to go out for a while, and I hoped you could stay here until
I return. There are some workmen coming, I'm not quite sure when. You
remember the argument at the party? Well Mr Bardon failed to get
Joshua to put a picture in his apartments, so at last, he hit on the
idea of buying mine. He got some lawyers to check the contract I made
with Joshua, and they decided the clauses disallowing the movement of
the painting are invalid, so I am legally allowed to sell the
painting. Mr Bardon is giving me ten times what I paid for it, and
taking on all the costs of moving it, and repairing the room."<p>

Peter stepped into the apartment, and into the room with the
picture. The paintings were gone, and dust sheets covered the empty
walls. The picture was showing a light fall of dirty grey snow, each
flake twisting and spiralling downwards to add imperceptibly to the
drift that was already there.<p>

He grow absorbed in watching the flakes. He found himself hypnotised
by them, watching them closely to see if he could discern the hidden
algorithms that controlled their tortuous paths.<p>

He heard a key turn in the outer door, and he turned to see two men in
mechanic's overalls, and a man he recognized from the party.<p>

"You would be Mr Bardon I presume. David asked me to stay and let you
in."<p>

"As you see, I have no need of you," Mr Bardon replied, holding up a
ring of keys, "but tell David I appreciate the thought. It is a
beautiful picture, isn't it?"<p>

"I wouldn't exactly say beautiful," replied Peter, "but fascinating,
and wonderful."<p>

"Yes, it is worth every penny of the expense, and more." and with that
he turned and signaled to the workmen.<p>

The two onlookers watched the workmen, and the picture for about half
an hour.  They said nothing, and the only sound was the buzz of the
power&#173;saw, and the reverberation of the chisel as the workman cut
a ten centimetre deep grove through plaster and lead in a square,
about a half a meter out from the picture, but reaching down to the
floor.<p>

"Nearly finished now. I should be breaking through the wall about
now," said one of the workman, switching on his power&#173;saw again,
"We'll cut away the sides first, then the bottom, and finally swing
the whole thing down from the top.  Then we apologise to the owner of
the apartment on the other side of this wall."<p>

The layer of lead was cut through, and the saw started to move easily
through plaster. And then there was a sudden chill in the room. Peter
looked at the picture to see it showing white dust, spraying out form
some source closer to them than could be seen, and then a smell of
metal, and smoke, and a deadly cold.<p>



<hr><a name="historyr"><h2>History Relates</h2></a>

<h3>Timothy G Roddis</h3>

The planet was much like any other.<p>

On its surface lived hordes of green, bug&#173;eyed creatures. All
intelligent, of course. They spoke a language, were aware of
themselves and what they were, and had a reassuringly short word to
describe the planet on which they lived. They didn't worship the sun,
or, indeed, any other strange idol. In fact, given a fairly loose
definition of the word, they could be considered to be people.  They
peopled this planet, had done for a couple of million years and had an
odd sort of belief that they always would.<p>

The flora and fauna was, in general, a pleasant shade of a deep red;
ruby grasses covering the floor of the planet. There used to be more
of this plant life, but the creatures removed much of it. Of course,
there was a section of the community who claimed this to be unwise,
but nobody listened to them, nobody wanted to.<p>

Centuries before these people, their fore&#173;fathers had walked this
scarlet planet. Great people who had built great
civilisations. However, given enough time, each civilisation would
collapse. Some were too expansionist, some too insular and others were
just superceded by somebody else's rather bigger brand of
`civilisation'. The only thing they had in common was a basic
inability to last the centuries intact.<p>

In other words, these people made their mistakes, just like any other
people, and given half a chance would muck anything up.<p>

And now, they had their `peak' of civilisation. Or civilisations, each
with their own idea of the others.<p>

In the main, the problem was simple. There were three
superpowers. While any two could be trusted to just about come up with
a compromise the other would be inclined to disagree. War was a
constant threat.<p>

Life went on. The people built their supermarkets, occasionally they
would dig up the remains of their past and let the archaeologists have
a look at it, before pouring in the concrete. The buildings gradually
grew bigger.<p>

Sooner or later, somebody decided to build a really tall
building. This was not because they particularly needed a tall
building, nor was it because tall buildings were considered to be at
all elegant. This was merely for the sake of constructing a really
tall building.<p>

The thing about really tall buildings is that they require really deep
foundations. This building was to be built with underground vehicle
storage facilities and to be connected to the local subterranean
travel system. Added to which it was going to be the tallest building
on the planet, its foundations would have to be pretty deep. It was an
adventurous development prospect and investors were cautious.<p>

The digging began. The area in which the building was to be built was
an infertile one and few remains of their ancient forbears existed
there. Without difficulty the digging progressed through to the early
eras of their evolution and the inert rocks that now represented that
age.<p>

It had been a long day and none of the workers wondered at the hard,
flat surfaced white rock they now dug through. Indeed very few
commented on the black, sticky gravel beneath and to the side. Even
had they spoken, the drilling would have drowned their voices. No, it
was not until they discovered the large, contorted knots of iron rods,
that anyone called the archaeologists.<p>

The geologists had confirmed that it was approximately ten million
years old, the sedimentary rock that had covered the discovery. Nobody
could have planted it there, it was all genuine. Now it was up to the
archaeologists to explain it all.<p>

It had been an old civilisation, struck by disaster, a comet, perhaps,
a famine, sunspots. A few surviving artifacts littered the area. And
it was those remnants that suggested something which the new people of
the planet could not face up to: they had not been the first to
populate this planet. There was horror at first, followed by
indignation; afterwards a quest for greater understanding.<p>

A lot of what survived was in the form of circular discs, recognisably
plastic, but with beautiful spectra spread across their diameter.<p>

Frighteningly, they had perished despite their apparently superior
technology.  For years the use of the strangest artifacts was
discussed, but when the script was deciphered, they discovered the
word `laser'.<p>

It took months of work before it was realised that there were noises
recorded on some of the discs. Many of the others showed a regular
pattern too, but that took longer to figure out.<p>

The creatures had television, there'd been an outcry at first, then
mutterings about the loss of the great art of conversation. After that
there were just the families staring, mesmerised by the set.<p>

The news was hardly pleasant viewing, always a partisan discussion on
the inevitability of planet&#173;wide warfare. Most people watched the
other side.<p>

The contents of the unexplained discs were discovered only weeks
later.<p>

They had not been the first to invent TV. It had been done differently
by their predecessors, but it was soon worked out.<p>

Then they found the box: `Final Message' read the battered label. The
box was military standard, and very strong. Inside lay one silver
coloured disc, heavily padded against time and tide.<p>

There had been three sides in the end: America, Europe and
Japan. Diplomacy had been difficult, if not impossible. Two sides
could be made to agree, but not three.<p>

For years now, only deadlock.<p>

But the Europeans were comparatively isolated from America and
Japan. They formulated a plan. They would send a nuclear missile from
Japan to America.  Then, later, they would send another in the reverse
direction. The two side would retaliate, and Europe would escape, able
to clean its wounds and continue life.<p>

They had it all worked out.<p>

For days the Americans and Japanese had done nothing. They hadn't like
the idea of being under fire, but one missile caused only a little
damage, hardly more than the border incidents. That wasn't the whole
story, however, something had gone wrong. No order had been issued by
the high commands. No missile should have been fired. The Generals
should have been aware long before they were awoken by the sound of
the alerts.<p>

The fact is, neither side wished to see the apocalypse. When the
damage was calculated the discovery of the Europeans' bomb design
trademarks lead them to vent their anger against the true
perpetrators.<p>

The Europeans had, to say the least, been caught by surprise. The
military units had been recalled, obediently they had returned to
their bases. The state was in mild disarray, security lax, expecting
their enemies' communication lines to have been broken.<p>

When a bomb went off in the European capital, it was the Americans who
claimed responsibility.<p>

This made the Japanese, caught out twice, look impotent. Hastily they
too took their revenge. They fired two missiles at Europe, not to be
outdone by the Americans.<p>

To the Americans, who had always been a little trigger happy, the
Japanese missiles mistakenly directed over their airspace were a
declaration of war.<p>

There followed a hazy patch of history where time ran fast then slow,
then fast once more; with the planet crippled, the last remaining
bunker recorded the `Final Message'.<p>

There were three green bug&#173;eyed creature superpowers. Their names
are rather hard to pronounce. Call them A, B and C.<p>

B was comparatively isolated from A and C. They formulated a plan.<p>

They had it all worked out.<p>



<hr><a name="lastrema"><h2>The Last Remake</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

As I looked up at the sparkling blue of the Pacific, my anger slowly
faded.  It always did out here, where I could truly say I was alone.
I methodically checked the displays for signs of danger: enough oxygen
for several days, enough fuel to land.  All equipment working as it
should, except the comm dish wanted re&#173;aligning.  I'd have to see
to that sooner or later, but no hurry.  I wasn't about to use it for
anything, after all.<p>

At five hundred miles out, it's still hard to think of the Earth as a
sphere; it fills over 120! of the view.  On a good day you can see
elephants in Africa, just patches of grey against the ground.  When I
passed over North Brazil, I could see the Amazon glinting in the
forest; nature had reclaimed its own after the fallout.  I thought
about last night's party.<p>

Anna would come back to me eventually.  She always had, anyway.  I
just wished she'd be a bit more discreet about it.  Okay, you can't
keep a secret for long on a station like ours; it's just too small
(there are plans for much larger habitats at some of the Lagrange
points, but that's several years off; besides, I like the view here).
She just needed time and she'd get bored with Dimitri, or he'd be
transferred somewhere.  Sometimes I could happily strangle her, but I
knew I'd forgive her, and we'd be happy until the next time, in a
week, or a month, or a year.<p>

I knew that I wouldn't return 'til I could look at her without
shouting.  That might be some time yet, so I double&#173;checked the
safety readings and switched out.<p>

<br>

I'm at a base on one of the poles, before the war.  Someone's
discovered a huge spaceship under the ice, and they're digging it up.
I've been through all this before, but I'm just an observer here.  I
know what's going to happen, but I can't stop it; I wouldn't want
to.<p>

It's The Thing from Another World (the 1951 black and white version,
not the 1982 remake), and one of my favourites.  Howard Hawks' protege
Christian Nyby directs.<p>

<br>

The film ended.  When the last of the credits had rolled up behind my
eyes, I switched back.  Undoing the safety web, I floated up out of
the chair, reached for one of the grab&#173;handles and propelled
myself back towards the airlock.<p>

Immersed in the routines and safety checks of vacuum drill, I climbed
into one of the suits in the rack, and stepped into the airlock
chamber.  A short code tapped on the keypad started the purge cycle,
and the outer doors opened.  I snapped my static line to the ring at
the edge of the lock, and stepped out into the night sky.  I couldn't
see the Earth from here, and the suit's filters cut in to shield me
from the sun's glare.<p>

When I was a kid, I used to go diving in the summer.  I remember
carrying the equipment down to the boat, sweating in my wetsuit while
we went out to the site.  I remember all the safety procedures we had
to go through.  But when I got my head in the water it was a totally
different world, filled with exotic fishes and fantastic seaweed, and
I thought I could see for miles.  Space is like that.  Shaking my head
in amusement, as I always do, I let go of the ring and walked across
the shuttle's hull to the comm dish.<p>

Immersion technology is great for watching movies.  You can't feel
your body, so you can devote all your attention to the film.  Better
yet, you can see all of the screen at once.  It's as if it's mapped
straight onto the retina; you can focus on whatever bit you want.  The
trouble is, I just love watching films, and no&#173;one's making them
any more.  I've got thousands in my personal library, but they're all
pre&#173;war.  No&#173;one else understands, not even Anna.
Especially not Anna.<p>

<br>

An hour later, when I'd re&#173;aligned the dish, I went inside and
took the shuttle back to the habitat.  They should have returned with
the preliminary results by now; after all, I'd been away for fourteen
hours.<p>

Whatever it was, it had a cometary orbit.  It wouldn't visit the sun
again for a hundred and ten years, and was skimming the Earth on its
way in.  Very convenient, that.  I'd advised caution at the open
meeting, but friend Dimitri was all for investigating.  He'd
discovered it, after all.<p>

The trip was scheduled for early this morning.  As I approached the
station, I could see the other shuttle in its docking bay.  It had
probably been back for hours.  I opened the comm link with the station
to request docking permission.  Rat was on duty.  We call him that
'cause he brought his pet rat up last trip; it died.  "Hi Rat.  Can I
come in please?"  Running joke: he'd say no, I'd ignore him.<p>

"Docking permission granted.  Approach when ready."<p>

"Hey, Rat!  It's me, yeah?"  Weird.  Shrugging, I closed the link and
guided the shuttle onto the docking interface.  When the airlock doors
opened, I pushed off into the sterile maintenance area and went
through decontamination.<p>

I didn't really want to see anyone right now; least of all Anna, who
nearly collided with me in the corridor.  "Good morning Jon.  I hope
you had a safe trip."  I just stared at her, then kicked off towards
my room in shock.  What was the woman trying to do to me?  She called
after me.  "There's a meeting this evening to discuss the explorer.
Come to the mess at 1800."  The explorer?  This should be
interesting.<p>

<br>

I took a shower and some sleep, then went to the mess.  Surprisingly,
nearly everyone was there, and on time.  I did a quick head count:
twenty six, almost the entire crew.  Most from the Japanese
Archipelagate, a few from Asia.  I got a coffee and clipped myself to
the wall by the door, watching the rows of placid crew members.  In
fact, the only person in the room who showed the least sign of
animation was friend Dimitri.  His eyes kept flicking my way, as if
trying to gauge my reaction to the scene.<p>

"The explorer is the most important thing that has happened to our
race to date," he said.  "While it's still near the sun, we must
devote as many resources as possible to studying it.  Of course, the
demolition project must be finished in time but," looking at me now,
"I think we can rely on you and Anna to do that?"  I gave him a brief
nod, unsure of his motive.<p>

"What we saw was incredible; the explorer is obviously of intelligent
design, and the fact that it's come so close to Earth can only mean
that we were meant to find it.  I believe that if we spend enough time
studying it, we'll discover something wonderful.  The vessel alone
could advance our construction sciences by decades, and who knows what
lies beyond the hull?"<p>

I looked over the sea of faces in the room.  Those that I could see
seemed totally lifeless, just staring at Dimitri.  He had them in the
palm of his hand, and I knew that whatever he suggested, they would do
without hesitation.  Disgusted, I unclipped myself and swung round
into the corridor.<p>

Anna followed.  She caught up with me at a corridor node.  Strange how
we only seemed to meet in corridors.  Probably something philosophical
there, I thought.  "Dimitri said we should finish the demolition.
I'll see you in maintenance at 1900."  I started to reply, but she'd
already kicked off in the other direction.<p>

<br>

Only when the station was disappearing behind us did I turn round and
look at her.  We were on our way to an American recon satellite.  We'd
seen it's orbit gradually decay, as it dipped in and out of the
atmosphere, slower each time.  It was on an equatorial orbit like
ours, but a lot lower; we thought it would come to Earth somewhere in
Africa.  When we'd stripped it of useful equipment, we'd blow it
up.<p>

"I guess I should apologise, Jon; I've probably been acting quite
strangely today.  It's just this explorer thing; if it's everything
Dimitri says it is, our lives are going to be changed forever."  She
looked at me in excitement and wide&#173;eyed innocence.  It worked
every time.  Nearly every time.  I remembered that same zeal in
Dimitri's voice, and turned away.<p>

We'd been working on the satellite for three days now, and we'd taken
out most of the useful equipment.  There were just the storage cells
and the military stuff left now.  We weren't going to touch the
latter; who knew what safeguards they'd put into it?  The Americans
were paranoid even before the war.  Besides, who was there to blow up
these days?<p>

We were approaching the satellite.  It hung against the stars like a
fly in amber; its solar panel wings still spread to catch the sun.
There was no compatible docking interface (the war was nearly fifty
years ago, after all), so we had to leave the shuttle some distance
away and go across in suits.  We both suited up and entered the
airlock.  It was odd, being so close but unable to touch.<p>

Halfway across, I made my move.  I'd suspected for a long time, but
seeing her close&#173;up in the shuttle confirmed my fears.  I grabbed
the other line and tugged hard to disorient her, but she recovered
more quickly than I'd thought, and whipped round to fight.<p>

Killing someone in a modern vacuum suit is harder than you might
think.  There are no dangling cables to catch on jagged edges, no
easily accessible controls to regulate airflow.  The visor is made of
toughened plastic, hard enough to deflect small meteorites without
cracking.  We must have made an odd couple, feverishly embracing under
the stars.<p>

Over her shoulder, I noticed the end of her safety line floating away.
It must have got cut or disconnected during the struggle.  I whipped
her round suddenly, and hit the quick&#173;release catches on her fuel
packs, throwing them away from me.  She managed to twist round again,
her visor brought suddenly next to mine.  As I brought my legs up and
kicked out, I could see the eyes dilate in shock.  Alien eyes.  With
the last fuel in her system, she managed to right herself, facing me.
Then the jets died out, and she silently sped away, towards the
atmosphere.  Waving.<p>

The inter&#173;suit comm crackled to life.  "Jon?  I suppose you've
guessed by now.  I'm not the same Anna you knew.  I am Anna, though;
I've regained many of her memories, her feelings.  It's odd.  I've
known you for half my life, but I only met you today.  Do you find
that odd?  I do.<p>

"The others wanted to kill you when you were sleeping, but I wouldn't
let them.  I wanted to talk to you before you died, so I was going to
kill you on the trip back to the station.  You probably realise we
have plans for the rest of your race, but you can't possibly know what
joy it is to be one of us.  Your memories will be intact, you know;
nothing is lost."<p>

She was almost lost to sight now.  All I could see was a faint spark
against the Indian Ocean.  After a long pause, "I love you Jon.  I
always have.  It's why I'm giving you a choice of deaths.  You can
either stay in the satellite and wait for them to get you, or you can
go back to our shuttle.  I've programmed it to destruct when I die,
which shouldn't be too long now.  You can still talk to me from there.
Won't it be wonderful to die together?"<p>

By this time, I'd managed to control my situation, and was floating
near the shuttle.  Frantically, I jetted back to the airlock and hit
the cycle code.  If I could stop the destruct sequence, I could still
make it back to Earth.  I typed a query in the shuttle's main computer
terminal.<p>

<code>INFORMATION ON DESTRUCT SEQUENCE?</code><p>

<code>SEQUENCE INITIATED.  DESTRUCTION WILL OCCUR ON TERMINATION OF
TRANSMITTED CODE.</code><p>

<code>INFORMATION ON TERMINATION OF SEQUENCE?</code><p>

<code>SEQUENCE IS IRREVERSIBLE.  IDENTIFICATION MADE BY RETINAL
IMAGING.</code><p>

Oh shit.  The shuttle's comm opened.  "Are you there, Jon?  Tell me
something before I die.  How did you know?  Why were you so sure?"<p>

"Anna had a tattoo behind her left ear since she was nineteen.
Remember how she had it done on her birthday, and regretted it?  You
probably didn't notice it, so you didn't grow one."  I remembered the
sight of her smooth skull as she sat in this very seat.  "Hell, you're
probably a virgin again.  Ha!"<p>

"I'm dying, Jon; I'm starting to enter the atmosphere.  Are you still
there?"  No I bloody well wasn't.  I was fastening the seals on my
suit helmet and getting back into the airlock.  I hit the emergency
purge code on the keypad and the outer door blew off, ejecting me into
space on a plume of wasted air.  "Goodbye, Jon."  The shuttle exploded
behind me, shooting fragments in all directions.<p>

<br>

I reckoned I was safe until the satellite came round the curve of the
Earth, within sight of the station.  I had about thirty minutes.  It
took most of that to persuade the satellite computer to re&#173;align
the main laser.<p>

In the last decades before the war, the Americans had built a working
prototype for their strategic defense initiative project.  The idea
was to blow ICBMs out of the sky as they fell to Earth.  What they
weren't letting on was that it was a manned satellite, with
accommodation for four crew members.  There was no air left in it;
time and meteorites had seen to that.  There had been one escape
capsule, but that was gone.  I had no idea if the crew had made it; I
didn't really care.<p>

Once I'd got past the protection levels, it was trivial to adjust the
control system.  The station was an easy target when it got past the
lens of the Earth's atmosphere.  The laser used the stored energy from
decades of solar panel collection, on the station's power source.  It
seemed a trifle melodramatic, but the explosions above would serve as
a warning to the whole race.<p>

I took stock of my situation.  I had a couple of hours of air left,
who knew how much time 'til the satellite's orbit finally decayed.  I
had only the communication gear in my suit, so anyone I could contact
was out of range.  I was dead, basically.  Nothing I could do.<p>

No, damn it!  There was still something I could do.  The explosives
were in place around the satellite; we'd been setting them up while we
stripped it.  I set all the timers inside and out, then waited.  I was
gazing out at the planet when a sudden memory came to me.  If I was
going to die, at least I could go out in style.<p>

It's at the end of John Carpenter's Dark Star.  There's this guy whose
ship's been blown up by a stubborn bomb, so he surfs into the
atmosphere on this bit of debris.  End of film.  Credits.  Great
stuff.  I went outside and cut away one of the solar panel segments.
My boots stuck to the metal sheeting, and I crouched down to give my
jets a centre of mass.  After a good burn, I was shooting away from
the satellite and I could stand up.<p>

<br>

It's wonderfully quiet out here.  I don't know if I'll even notice
when the satellite explodes.  I haven't seen any debris yet.<p>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

Lenny was in front of his computer.  It was story&#173;time; what
would he write?  He flicked the switch and began.<p>

Lenny flicked the switch and gasped as the sheer green silk letters
stung out from the monitor display.  Plunging in the Net!  The skin of
his forebrain all that held him between sanity and information
apocalypse - the danger was the highest when his fingers tapped the
keys.  They felt electric.  What would he write?  He hunched over the
console and began.<p>

Lenny flicked the switch and gasped with the hit as the green glowing
glory of computer words lit up his retinas with its flare.  Great
gorgeous visions of insanities made concrete gaped out from unfinished
dusty dream stock.  Semi&#173;stories made pseudo&#173;flesh,
unfinished Frankenstein creations pawing in a nowhere flux!  He was
ready to pour his sense into the net, to glory in the vision uniquely
his.  What would he write?  He slouched back in his chair, relaxed
like the hunter he was, and began.<p>

Lenny flicked the switch.  He was no mere typewriter jock, him, he was
the Keyboard King, his easy fingers playing out men's dreams.
Creation poured from him with all the extravagance of light, he threw
his soul into the machine and never tired of the throwing: "This is
the stuff to give them," he said, as his impossible, individual
visions crowded up to choke him in his own heady splendour.  He spat
out words as if they were green neon teeth and his own creativity had
punched him in the mouth.  What would he write?  He licked his lips in
happy expectation and began.<p>

What was hackspace?  Hackspace was the integral space between the
computer hack and screen, the swirl of the imagination chaos in which
all forms - if so programmed - could take place.  Mens' dreams became
virtual reality in the matrix of their own minds, and hackspace had
the pulpware to programme those dreams.  It was mental domination.  In
the deep mind chasms between the typing of the words and their
settlement on the monitor's green permanence, all possible worlds took
place; the hack was master of fate and knew it, dictating his own
future to impress it on his readers, surfing on the vicarious surge of
his own secret dreams - his own beliefs in his true nature.  That was
the trap of hackspace for the jockeys: a computer monitor's not a
mirror, it's a pit, and you pour in what you want and surf the flow,
living in it, all the way down to the depths.  Lenny knew this, but he
was Keyboard Kaiser, his dextrous digits doing the rhumba over the
tap&#173;tap&#173;tap&#173;space, sexy Venus prose, forgetting for a
while the gross necessities of existence.  He flicked the switch and
began.<p>

Lenny was silent in his office, pulling the strands of a world plot
invisibly together, suave and still in his assured mastery.  The phone
rang: a deal to make.  Big bucks span big wheels.  He picked it up - a
moment, two, three passed and poured together into minutes as details
were filled in.  Precise, Lenny put it down again.  "Take a letter,
Miss Stavely," he said.  "To General Arminguez in Brazil."  Miss
Stavely ripped her glasses off and swung her stunning legs over the
desk.  "What did you want me to take, big boy?"<p>

Lenny was running like a stallion through the hot jungle, over and
through the impediment of undergrowth, crashing past the monstrous
vegetation which flapped against him like the obscene tentacles of
some gross anemone.  He was being chased.  His karma gun was in his
hand and ready, but there was no telling its efficiency and he'd
rather not face the bad guys when they knew their stuff.  They had the
Gortroopers on his trim tail: the toughest, sweatiest hombres in the
known universe and then some stars, the ones who could burn you beyond
death.  But he was fast and slick, they wouldn't catch Mean Len
without tasting their own fear burn.  He dodged behind a banyan,
flicked the switch of the slim karma gun, and when he clocked their
white&#173;eyes he began.<p>

Lenny rode his white palatino horse into Fractious Person's Gulch,
sloping easy in the moulded saddle, leering the guts out of the cosy
dull townies who dared look up from their know&#173;nothing
one&#173;(dirt)&#173;track confidence.  He was the spook&#173;rider
who shot the villains in Byronic inconsequentiality, the mad bad
groover who was too stoned on the prairie heat in apocalypse
burn&#173;blown dust to acknowledge the love of the good woman which
kept him running through the driftgrass, wind flowing for him like it
never had before.  He was the hero without spurs, dead legend of the
West, and there he burst out forever against the wide rolling prairy.
He flipped his switch 'gainst the horse's side and the gallop
began.<p>

"So tell me about hackspace," said Sir William to the jiving assassin,
the death fate hunter who lent meaning to his kills throughout all
oblivion.  "It's easy, Sir William," he laughed, lean&#173;eyed, and
popped pills into his hollow cheeks to rattle their fever dreams in
his burnt&#173;out forebrain.  "Hackspace sets up a conceptual world
which the user - the `reader', as we call him - can access any time, a
world of purest reality&#173;clean happenings where the image spins
out in eternal possibility for ever and ever.  This data is contained
on a durable hard copy we call paper, whose information can be
interfaced up to twenty, forty, a hundred years after the initial
programming.  Hackspace is the enduring brain vomit that'll draw in
men's minds for generations.  They'll play forever."  "Hot dog," said
Sir William.  "Can you provide this medium for me in quantity?"  "Can
I ever?"<p>

Lenny, hack&#173;jock, demon assassin, apocalyptic fictioneer, set up
to burn the world.  He had the jazz control to dreams, he'd won the
death&#173;fate oblivion sex biz mastery which gave him dominance of
humanity in forever.  He flicked the switch and began.<p>

They burst into the computer room the next morning.  Lenny was
immobile before the still&#173;glowing monitor, grotesquely twisted,
quite dead.  Someone had shoved his head up his own backside.  There
was nothing they could do.  Hackspace had claimed its own.  End.<p>



<hr><a name="asenseof"><h2>A Sense of Belonging</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

My earliest memories are of my father.  He came home one night, his
clothes smelling of cheap whisky, his thoughts smelling of her.  I've
never been able to read thoughts like the vicar can, but I just
couldn't help picking up my father's that night; he was broadcasting
like a radio mast.  I suppose he sensed my revulsion, stumbled to his
locked desk drawer for the whip he kept there.  "Don't you dare judge
me, you little shit," he said.<p>

It was an evil thing, with sharp little bones sewn into the tip; he
told me they were human.  I suppose he must have hated himself that
first time.  He would have sent me away if there were anywhere I could
go, but my mother was dead before I was two, and there was no&#173;one
else.  Perhaps if he'd ever left any marks, someone would have noticed
and done something.  I used to dream of breaking into that desk and
stealing the whip; I'd cut it up into little pieces with the garden
shears, or fling it on the bonfire where it belonged.<p>

Perversely, I treasure those first memories best from all my
childhood.  They remind me of how far I've come.<p>

As the months passed, it became a ritual for him.  Although it hurt
more every time than I remembered, I became used to it in my own way.
Don't misunderstand me, I never enjoyed it; I'm not some sort of sicko
like my father.<p>

I started to retreat into myself at even the mention of pain.  It was
a natural defense, and I don't think he really noticed; he was far too
absorbed in it to see anybody but himself.  I learned to construct a
tough cocoon around my inner self.  It still hurt as much as ever, but
somehow it didn't seem to matter as much; the humiliation had gone.<p>

One day, I got hold of the key to the desk drawer.  My father came
home worse than usual, collapsed into a chair and fell asleep, snoring
loudly.  He always kept the key on a chain round his neck; I was sure
I'd waken him, but somehow I managed to remove the chain and creep to
the desk.  It was then that I realised there was no whip; it was a
thing of the mind, born of the bitterness of failure and
self&#173;disgust.<p>

My plans of revenge didn't stop, though; they just got more violent.
I used to lie awake at night, thinking of new and more painful ways to
kill my father.  When I finally slept, I would dream of vampires...<p>

<br>

Forever I wander the gloomy halls of this twilight place, fixed
between the lands of day and night.  The high&#173;up windows have
never let in sunlight, if it exists here (I used to think I remembered
the sun; perhaps I only dreamed it).  I saw the outside once; in one
of the attics, there's a window with loose boards.  If you pry one
away there's a view of the moor, stretching away to the horizon, and
far beyond for all I know.<p>

I'm not alone in this place; I can hear the screams echo in the drafty
corridors, in the darker gloom that passes for night.  I even saw a
hand once, human I think.  It was on a chopping board in one of the
kitchens, a cleaver lying bloodied next to it; hunter and prey in the
same grave.  But I've never seen a single person in all the time I've
been here (how long is that now?).<p>

At night, I hide in the cellars; one of them is filled with
over&#173;sized chairs and tables, a man&#173;made forest of turned
wood.  I have a nest at the back, with a blanket and a cache of food.
If the vampires come for me there, I've always thought, I'll have a
handy supply of stakes.<p>

<br>

When I first went away to school, they could sense the loneliness, the
gulf of separation between us, even with their untrained psyches.
Naturally, being children, they taunted me without mercy.  I suppose I
have my father to thank for the training he'd unwittingly given me,
and I withdrew when the taunting began.  Even the sharpest of their
attacks bounced off the hard exterior of my shell.  When they could
see that I just didn't care, they left me alone.  I never made any
friends though.<p>

I hated church, too.  I can vividly remember sitting on some hard,
uncomfortable bench in itching best trousers, watching the vicar with
his bright robes and shock haircut.  The whole school had to go every
Sunday, to listen to that evangelical asshole.  One day I let my guard
slip, and some of my plans for my father's death slipped out.  I think
I've already mentioned the vicar's power; he picked me out of the
crowd right then, branded me a sinner before the whole school.  I can
still recall his eyes drilling straight into my brain, and his
accusation reverberating there.<p>

Eventually I passed through school with reasonable success; not too
high, not too low.  It's been said that school days are the best days
of your life; that's not entirely true for me, but at least I was away
from my father.<p>

<br>

During the day, I scavenge for food.  It means rushing quickly through
the huge kitchens, head down to avoid seeing the meat hooks, swinging
in some breeze as if hungry for flesh.  The lofty rooms seem somehow
claustrophobic with the smell of hanging game, and I can hear the
scurrying of rats in the walls.<p>

In the larders I can usually find something worth eating: maybe a lump
of cheese or hard bread, if I'm lucky a stale pie.  Some sour milk
perhaps.  I don't know who stocks the larders; maybe the vampires,
fattening up their prey.  I've never seen any of them.<p>

There's something curious and vaguely frightening about this place:
the dimensions are all wrong.  I'm fairly sure the vampires are about
our size, so they didn't build it unless they actually like feeling
dwarfed by doorways (which I wouldn't put past them).  I want to know
what's going to happen when the giants come back.<p>

<br>

When I finally came home at 16, she had moved in with my father, so I
left for the city.  Of course, it wasn't the communal hive of mental
unity that government propaganda claimed; I'd never expected that.
But it did take me in, find a place for me.  I'm grateful for this.<p>

I travelled by night, walking in shadows.  I took what work came my
way, but mostly I sifted what the rich discard.  It's incredible what
people throw away if it isn't perfect: I've found some designer
mirrorshades, a leather jacket with a ripped sleeve, a single silver
earring (part of a matched pair, I assume); a bird of prey, about to
strike.  I've had one ear pierced for it; they call me Hawk now.<p>

I refuse to join one of the gangs; I've always worked better on my
own, and I don't like taking orders.  Besides, I can look after
myself.  If I sense people coming, I hide inside myself, reflecting
what they expect to see.  The other denizens of the underworld see one
of their own, and let me pass.  The cops (when they venture this far
into the city) see a citizen hurrying home after dark.<p>

It's only a surface deception, of course.  I can fit in anywhere, but
never feel at home.  It might help if I knew what home was like.<p>

<br>

My cellar isn't safe any more.  I found a girl under my blanket there
last week; she was shivering and very pale.  I didn't know whether she
was human or vampire, so I fled.  I don't know how long I can last.  I
haven't eaten well for days; my strength is fading.  I haven't been
able to sleep, either; they're after me now, and nowhere is safe to
rest.<p>

<br>

Yesterday, I crept back to my cellar (empty now, thank God), and
equipped myself with a supply of food and a bundle of chair legs with
sharp, ragged ends.  I've decided to keep on the move; it's safest
that way, 'cause they won't be able to lay traps.<p>

<br>

They've found me at last.  I woke from a fitful sleep in some
cupboard, to hear them padding the bare floor outside.  Panicking, I
burst out into the room and dove through a gap for the door.<p>

I can hear them padding behind me now, in a surreal nightmare chase
through dusty corridors and forgotten halls.  All I can remember are
vague fragments: pounding through an empty ballroom, flying up a
baroque staircase, wrenching open heavy doors.<p>

Both ends of this passage are blocked off now; there's no escape.  I
wander into a bedroom and collapse onto a decaying four poster, curled
up in shock.  She climbs between the heavy drapes, and straddles me,
eyes dilated from the hunt.  The last thing I recognise before the
sharp teeth descend on my throat is the familiar pale skin, almost
translucent in the moonlight.<p>

There is such power in this form, such freedom.  I can track my prey
by smell alone; I could do it blindfolded.  And then the kill.  What
joy there is in the sharp tang of fear on the breeze, the warm flow of
lifeblood as I sink my teeth into smooth flesh...<p>

<br>

I wake from my recurrent dream (no longer frightening now) to see
them.  The pale one bends over me, her teeth glinting in the
moonlight.  I slowly rise from the gutter, to accept her cold embrace.
I feel something strange: a sense of belonging.<p>



<hr><a name="mapsinam"><h2>Maps in a Mirror by Orson Scott
Card</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

I'm never quite sure what to make of Orson Scott Card's fiction.
Sometimes I think his work is brilliant, with insight into character
and a marvellous emotional power in his writing.  At other times I
perceive in his work a saccharine sentimentality, a banal morality
that forgives the worst atrocity if the perpetrator's guilt is sincere
enough and his (almost always `his') atonement is painful enough.<p>

The publication of the massive short story collection <cite>Maps in a
Mirror</cite> gives ample opportunity for consideration is this
questions, and there's plenty of evidence for both points of view.
Now, when I say `massive', I mean it.  <cite>Maps in a Mirror</cite>
consists of nearly 700 pages of close&#173;printed text, and with the
exception of the Worthing/Capitol stories (collected in <cite>The
Worthing Saga</cite>) and the Mormon stories in <cite>The Folk of the
Fringe</cite>, the 46 stories here represent all of Card's short
fiction so far, or at least all that he is willing to see reprinted.
This is a collection that deserves careful savouring.<p>

Seeing these stories together stresses the theme that is most
noticeable in Card's writing, the pain and mutilation (emotional and
physical) of his characters.<p>

Card deprecates the tendency in the horror genre towards the graphic
portrayal of violence and claims, "I don't write horror".  Yet we have
`Eumenides in the Fourth Floor Lavatory' (man tormented by malformed
children who seem to be exteriorisations of his evil character), `Fat
Farm' (hedonist becomes grossly fat, has himself copied to a new, thin
body, leaving his old self to be tortured back to thinness), `Closing
the Timelid' (when time&#173;travel makes it possible to commit
suicide non&#173;fatally, death becomes the ultimate trip for
drug&#173;addicts), `Memories of my Head' (man trapped in unhappy
marriage blows his head off but even then cannot escape), `A Thousand
Deaths' (repressive government tortures dissident by repeatedly
killing him and bringing him back to life again), `Unaccompanied
Sonata' (musician is forbidden to play, disobeys, and his fingers are
amputated so he cannot disobey again), `Kingsmeat' (human&#173;eating
aliens take over colony and slowly dismember and consume the
inhabitants).  I could also mention the archetypal example of Card's
"limb fiction", the novel <cite>A Planet Called Treason</cite> (hero
grows lots of extra arms and legs and then has them chopped off).  Are
you an Orson Scott Card character?  Then count your limbs.<p>

These are just the physical traumas that Card puts his characters
through; many more stories are constructed around emotional pain no
less traumatically portrayed, but less easy to give the flavour of in
a short review.<p>

I detect two strands to these stories of pain.  The first, and less
important, portrays pain as punishment, and includes `Eumenides', `Fat
Farm', and a few others.  I have no real disagreement with these
stories, and despite Card's claims not to write in the genre, they're
fine horror stories, on a par with those of George R R Martin or Ian
Watson, and certainly Card has no shortage of gruesome invention or
nastily observed character detail.  There is, perhaps, evidence of an
ascetic dislike of bodies, perhaps most obvious in `Fat Farm', which
Card describes as `physical autobiography' in his afterword.<p>

The second strand is much harder for me to get to grips with, and the
closest I can come is, pain as affirmation.  These stories comprise
the balance of the stories described above, and much of Card's most
important novels, including <cite>Hart's Hope</cite>,
<cite>Songmaster</cite>, <cite>Ender's Game</cite> and <cite>Red
Prophet</cite>.  In these stories the hero (almost always male)
undergoes terrible physical and (more importantly) emotional pain, but
emerges with the realisation that it has all been very important and
worthwhile.  In these stories, pain becomes the raison d'etre of the
character; proof that he is worth something, that his beliefs are
important; pain is badge of pride.  These are stories of martyrdom.<p>

It is as though Card has a burning desire to write fiction that
strikes at the heart of its readers, fiction that grapples with
universal truths, fiction that is `important'.  And he knows how this
is done: important fiction involves the suffering of the protagonist;
important fiction is tragic and painful.  And he knows that out of
pain come wisdom and insight.<p>

But there are traps in this schema, and Card falls into them.  The
first is to presume too much, to tell the reader how wise the hero is,
how much pain he is suffering, rather than showing this convincingly.
Suffering does not automatically make one a saint; pain and guilt are
not in themselves enough to convince: there must be good writing and
excellent characterisation as well.  Otherwise, the torment becomes
hysterical posturing, the catharsis does not convince.  I think that
<cite>Songmaster</cite> falls into this trap, as does <cite>Speaker
for the Dead</cite>.<p>

The second trap arises out of Card's tendency to portray redemption as
the outcome of the suffering.  In these stories, suffering and guilt
are enough.  You can be forgiven of your sins if you suffer.  Terrible
things happen, but through pain the wound may be healed.  These
stories tend towards an artificial sentimentality.<p>

An example of this is `Lost Boys' (a family who lose a difficult child
to a murderer, but when he comes back as a ghost they are able to give
him the perfect Christmas he never had when he was alive), which has
(apparently) attracted a great deal of controversy and criticism
because Card tells the story as though it concerned his own family.
Card quotes Karen Joy Fowler as being the most succinct of the
critics: "By telling your story in the first person with so much
detail from your own life, you've appropriated something that doesn't
belong to you.  You've pretended to feel the grief of a parent who has
lost a child, and you don't have a right to feel that grief."  Well, I
don't object to this; Card's use of his own family in the story is his
own business, surely.  But this issue may have obscured a deeper flaw
in the story, which by placing the schmalzy Christmas scene at the
end, gives the impression that because the family are sorry that the
son has been killed, it is somehow alright, that everything is OK at
the end of the story.<p>

Something of the sort goes on in the novel <cite>Ender's Game</cite>,
where humanity destroys an alien race, and then through Ender's pain
and guilt is given a second chance at peaceful co&#173;existence.<p>

Related to this issue is Card's use of the perpetrator of suffering as
a messiah figure.  I have already noted Ender, but there's also the
Shepherd character in `Kingsmeat' (who saves his people from being
killed outright by the flesh&#173;eating aliens by the expedient of
slowly dismembering them instead).  Card himself refers us to Gene
Wolfe's use of the torturer Severian as the messiah in <cite>The Book
of the New Sun</cite>: "I think it's interesting that when Gene Wolfe
set out to create a Christ&#173;figure in his <cite>Book of the New
Sun</cite>, he also made his protagonist begin as apprentice torturer,
so that the one who suffered and died to save others is depicted as
one who also inflicts suffering: it is a way to explicitly make the
Christ&#173;figure take upon himself, in all innocence, the darkest
sins of the world."<p>

I've tried to indicate what goes wrong in Card's writing, but there
are occasions on which he gets it right, and doesn't fall into any of
these traps.  `Kingsmeat' is one, `Unaccompanied Sonata' another, and
<cite>Hart's Hope</cite> is a third.  And when he gets it right, his
writing does have a mythic power to it.<p>

And there are stories that don't involve pain or amputation.  The best
story in <cite>Maps in a Mirror</cite> is `The Originist', a very well
thought out and well&#173;written novella about family and community
that is set in the milieu of Isaac Asimov's <cite>Foundation
series</cite>.  It is interesting to note that Card "poured a novel's
worth of love and labour into it" (if only he did this much work on
every story of his!) and a little sad that he "firmly [believes that
Asimov] is the finest writer of American prose in our time, bar
none."<p>

In the end, I am prepared to forgive the bad stories in <cite>Maps in
a Mirror</cite>, and to treasure the good.  And you should certainly
read it - read it with care - and judge for yourself.<p>



<hr><a name="expatria"><h2>Expatria (Keith Brooke)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Expatria is a colony world, settled by generation ships from Earth.
Centuries ago, a religious revolution threw out the old technology:
"it was a thing of the past, an unwanted relic from the early days of
the colony, when the ways of Earth has remained important."  Now,
Expatria is divided into quasi&#173;feudal city&#173;states with a
strange mixture of archaic and modern technologies and
institutions.<p>

Matt Hanrahan is the rebellious elder son of the Prime of Newest
Delhi, whose interest in electronics makes him unattractive to the
powerful anti&#173;technology Conventist religious movement.  He is
framed for the murder of his father, possibly by his evil younger
brother Edward, and escapes to the more liberal Alabama City, where
scientific research is directed by the bureaucrat Kasimir Sukui.  With
a repaired radio/tv set they contact the descendants of those original
colonists who had decided to remain in orbit, who have received
messages from an approaching ship from Earth that intends to `improve'
the lives of the Expatrians whether they like it or not.<p>

So far, so standard.  But Brooke's focus is on the development of his
major characters, Hanrahan and Sukui.  Hanrahan, at the start a
rebellious dilettante, finds maturity and a cause that he can believe
in and even risk his life for.  Sukui aspires to the ideal of the
emotionless, rational scientist, and takes a great deal of pride in
his `understanding' of other people and his lack of personal
attachment.  While Hanrahan learns discipline and commitment, Sukui
learns of love and emotion, and like Hanrahan he finds a cause that is
important to him.<p>

However, interesting as this character development is, the other
characters never quite manage to escape from their roles, and while
Brooke defies expectations with some remarkable twists at the end, a
large number of loose ends are left flailing around - including the
approaching ship from Earth, about which nothing more is heard.  I
found that this mish&#173;mash of ideas never quite jelled into a
story that would grab me - like his character Sukui, Brooke maintains
too much of a detachment to really engage the reader.<p>

Keith Brooke is a young British writer from the <cite>Interzone</cite>
school, with one previous novel, <cite>Keepers of the Peace</cite>
(1990).  His promise is not fully realised in <cite>Expatria</cite>,
but I have no doubt that he will improve with experience, and I intend
to keep a lookout for his next novel.<p>



<hr><a name="stalinst"><h2>Stalin's Teardrops (Ian Watson)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

If Ballard excels at making the familiar strange by examining it from
a new perspective, then Watson excels at making the unfamiliar even
stranger.  Stalin's Teardrops is his sixth book of short stories, and
Watson's fluency and profligacy show no signs of flagging.  The mix of
genres has changed over the years, and in keeping with the direction
Watson seems to be going in, there are almost no sf stories in this
collection, the bulk being fantasy and the cleverly&#173;observed
horror at which he is expert.<p>

The range of his work is still there, and if the inventiveness is a
little more macabre, so much the better.  The best of the horror is
the marvellously understated `Tales from Weston Willow' and the best
of the fantasy is `The Pharoah and the Mademoiselle' which for no
apparent reason has large sections in blank verse.<p>

I would have liked to have seen more sf in this collection: Watson's
fantasy and horror are fine, but lack the bite and sheer insistency of
the best of his sf.  In my opinion, Watson's recent horror and fantasy
novels <cite>The Power</cite>, <cite>Meat</cite> and <cite>The Fire
Worm</cite> are not nearly as good as his most recent sf novel,
<cite>The Flies of Memory</cite>.<p>

But you probably know by now whether you like the writing of Ian
Watson.  If you do, get hold of this collection and enjoy!<p>



<hr><a name="historie"><h2>Histories...</h2></a>

<h3>Matthew Freestone</h3>

... of a sort, are what Gene Wolfe has written in his books
<cite>Soldier of the Mist</cite> and its sequel, <cite>Soldier of
Arete</cite>. The books purport to derive from scrolls, written in
archaic Latin, which have fallen into Wolfes possession.<p>

<cite>Mist</cite> is set in 479 BC during the invasion of Greece by
the armies of the Persian king Xerxes. The narrator, `Latro' (a name
which means mercenary or soldier) awakens after the Battle of Plataea
to discover he can remember practically nothing. A healer tells him
that he was injured in the battle, fighting for Xerxes army and that
his wound has caused his memory loss. The healer gives Latro a scroll
to record his experiences in, since he forgets recent events after
about twelve hours. It is Wolfes translation of this scroll that we
are supposed to be reading, when we read this book.<p>

Shortly after the start of the story, the other aspect of Latro's
disability is revealed. Latro and his friend (referred to as `the
black man' throughout <cite>Mist</cite>) travel to Thebes where they
fall in with the poet Pindar and a slave girl `Io'. They visit the
temple of Apollo and as the pythoness there begins to prophesy for
Latro we read `I paid little attention to her because my eyes were on
a Golden man, larger than any man should be, who had stepped silently
from an alcove.' Latro has met one of the most powerful of the Greek
gods.<p>

This device of an amnesiac narrator recording his own history presents
Wolfe with some interesting problems; to be realistic, Latro must
write with brevity- he is travelling a lot and has only limited space
on the scroll. Wolfe makes it look easy; the prose has a spare beauty
and never becomes a mere catalogue of events. Perhaps less well
handled is the fact that Latro must constantly remind himself in the
text, of things that we remember easily, such as the names of his
friends. This can become slightly annoying, but it is difficult to see
how the problem could have been avoided.<p>

The more serious problem of how to provide direction in a story
written by a man incapable of making plans is overcome largely by the
frequent action of the gods in Latros life. Latro discovers that it is
Demeter who has taken his memories and thus he becomes a pawn in the
plans of various of the gods who help him or hinder him to further
their own plans. When Latro is not engaged on his quest to recover
himself he acts almost as a passive recorder as we are taken on a tour
of pre&#173;Classical Greece - Sparta, Athens (sacked by the
Persians), Delphi, and Eleusis are all in here.<p>

The interesting point here is that all the places and people in the
book are named as Latro called them, thus Athens is referred to as
Thought (due to its associations with Athene), Sparta as Rope and so
forth. This has two effects, firstly it keeps the reader at one remove
from the landscape of Latros world and so paradoxically makes it more
real. For if Wolfe had used the familiar name of Athens (for example)
we would immediately imagine the mythical city of Theseus and lose the
sense of the ruined city Latro encounters. The second effect is to
drastically improve your knowledge of that period of history - if you
do not understand at least the most important references then the
story will completely pass you by. (I recommend <cite>The Cartoon
History of the Universe</cite> by Larry Gonick for complete beginners
in the subject, followed by a dose of Herodotus (whose line Wolfe
follows quite strongly)).<p>

<cite>Soldier of Arete</cite>, the sequel, feels completely different
to its predecessor. Where <cite>Mist</cite> revels in the exploration
of a new world, <cite>Arete</cite> is very dark indeed. Latro becomes
involved in a rescue mission and kills a fair number of people during
this part of the book. This seems to induce a deep depression in Latro
and the tone of the book mirrors his interior darkness.  Most of the
significant events in <cite>Arete</cite> are presented very subtly in
the text and I am not sure I have fully understood it. Latro acquires
or perhaps, comes to embody, the arete or fighting virtues of the
title. There are several references to possession; is Latro being
taken over by Ares? (or Pleistorus, as he is usually known in this
book) Wolfe is, as usual, not giving anything away.<p>

Latro also becomes more of a character in this book, as he recalls
some fragments of his past. He gains some limited ability to plan
after he is taught some of the Art of Memory. The book ends when Latro
sets sail, with a group of slaves he helps to escape, for his home.<p>

There are numerous parallels between this series and Wolfes earlier
series, <cite>The Book of the New Sun</cite>. Both texts purport to
descend to us from a distant time, and to record the history of their
narrators. Severian of course, remembers everything, while Latro can
remember virtually nothing, but both men seem similar insofar as they
do not know who they are; Latro in the obvious sense, and Severian in
the more subtle sense that he does not at first know the role which
has been appointed to him.<p>

A third book <cite>Soldier of Sidon</cite> is supposed to conclude the
series, but to my knowledge Wolfe has no contract to write it and so
Latro's tale must remain incomplete, at least for the moment.<p>



<hr><a name="prospero"><h2>Prospero's Books (directed by Peter
Greenaway)</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

The last decade was a good one for Shakespearean drama, with the
emergence of Kenneth Branagh (heralded as the new Olivier, marked by
his impressive new version of <cite>Henry V</cite>, Olivier's wartime
masterpiece), Derek Jarman's atmospheric <cite>The Tempest</cite> (his
latest, and possibly last film will be based on Marlowe's <cite>Edward
II</cite>, bringing him back to Elizabethan drama), and, at the end,
the making of a new highly accomplished version of
<cite>Hamlet</cite>, in which Mel Gibson proved that he's equal to
classical acting as much as playing rugged Australian heroes. As one
of the first films released this decade, <cite>Hamlet</cite>
demonstrated the continued resurgence of interest in Shakespeare
plays, not seen previously since the time of <cite>Chimes at
Midnight</cite> and <cite>Ran</cite>, more than twenty years
ago. Prospero's Books is interesting in many ways with respect to
this. Instead of a young actor, there is almost a return to the
Olivier tradition, with the lead role taken by John
Geilgud. Nonetheless, under Greenaway's direction, there is little
resemblance to the Old Vic style of the Olivier films, (<cite>Henry
V</cite> is also notable for, as with all Greenaway's films, having
used music specially composed by an already renowned contemporary
composer - William Walton.)<p>

The basis of <cite>Prospero's Books</cite> is an ambitious one - a
version of <cite>The Tempest</cite< with John Geilgud playing Prospero
has inevitably received a great deal of publicity. Since the
unexpected success of <cite>Drowning by Numbers</cite>, and the mild
controversy surrounding <cite>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her
Lover</cite>, Peter Greenaway has been elevated from his previous
status as a sort of intellectual cult figure, which was apparently
even unchanged by the enormous critical acclaim received for the
startling, compelling <cite>The Draughtsman's Contract</cite>, which
was his first real feature film (<cite>The Falls</cite>, though more
than 3 hours long, is in the same class as his shorts such as
<cite>Vertical Features Remake</cite>).<p>

<cite>Prospero's Books</cite> was thus already perceived as
significant months before it was released, and has appeared in the
midst of an unprecedented blaze of publicity.  However, there seems to
be no evidence that Greenaway has changed direction.  From the opening
scenes, there is no doubt that it is a Greenaway film, and the
distinctive characteristics we all know and love are still
there. There are changes though. The video editing technology used to
such effect in his <cite>Television Dante</cite>, (and later in his
tribute to Mozart, <cite>M is for Man, Music and Mozart</cite>,) is
very obvious, for example.<p>

Despite this large&#173;scale exploration of the scope of cinema, the
film is nonetheless very theatrical, perhaps to remind the viewer of
the dramatic origins of the film: all the action is confined to
stage&#173;like sets, often deliberately enclosed and limited, and
usually highly stylised. The sumptuous costumes similarly echo the
unreality of stage production: ludicrously large ruffs, platform shoes
and ornate hats create a bizarre impression. Many stage directors
prefer to bring the inherent unnaturalness of the form to the
attention of the audience, and it is this necessity to remind the
audience of the artificiality of the experience which has
characterised Peter Greenaway's films. As usual, there is a rigid
framework for the film: the books which Prospero brought with him from
Milan are listed throughout the film.<p>

These books betray many of the obscure interests which have
characterised the imagery in Greenaway's previous films: almost
redolent of Borges, they range from the amusing to the arcane, imbued
with antique learning, with mention of heretical beliefs, and echoes
of old obsessions. The books provide the expected link with previous
films, as well as contributing to the breakdown of the barrier between
viewer and filmmaker.<p>

As Prospero, an imposing figure entirely in control of events, Geilgud
is an inspired choice. The film is so centred around the character
that all the characters appear to speak through him, for most of the
film. This is most striking when it comes to Caliban, played by the
dancer Michael Clark, for whom words are clearly unnecessary. The
image we are presented with is rather that of a stage&#173;manager
controlling every detail of a performance, autocratic and
omniscient. From the magnificent costume to the hoards of naked
dancers attending him, Prospero dominates the film to an unprecedented
degree.<p>

This is a radical and visually stunning reworking of <cite>The
Tempest</cite>, and one of the most enjoyable films of a Shakespeare
play. While it is probably not Greenaway's greatest film, it is one of
the most entertaining, and demonstrates clearly that he has no
shortage of potential to continue to produce good films.<p>



<hr><a name="sorceres"><h2>The Sorceress and the Cygnet (Patricia
McKillip)</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

Patricia McKillip is widely known for producing books with different
concerns to those of most fantasy writers.  Even the more traditional
fantasy: The <cite>Riddle Master of Hed</cite> trilogy, and <cite>The
Forgotten Beasts of Eld</cite> have an eerie strangeness about them,
but many of her other works, such as the strange sf novel <cite>Fool's
Run</cite>, and the unsettling dream imagery of the psychological
exploration <cite>Stepping From the Shadows</cite>, are less familiar
still.<p>

Her latest novel, <cite>The Sorceress and the Cygnet</cite> belongs
very firmly with the former books, but is nonetheless an interesting
novel in many ways.  The story concerns Corleu, of the Wayfolk
(travelling people), whose appearance and ancestry have something odd
in them.  Something is changing in the rhythm of life, and Corleu
begins to find mythical figures coming to life, and is forced into a
quest, apparently of great cosmological importance.<p>

But though the plot may not offer much new, the world itself is richly
imagined.  McKillip has a talent for inventing believable and
involving worlds and characters, which are nonetheless quite far
removed from traditional fantasy ideas.  The cosmology is particularly
well spun out, the preternatural beings are believable and vital, and
the way they fit into the society, in myth and folklore is convincing.
The attention to the importance of folklore, and to different kinds of
magic, is also well brought off. Magic is not presented as something
other to society, and there is a seamless track from folk belief and
skill to `high' magic.  Few authors have as much detail when it comes
to the ubiquitous presence of lore in society, even down to children's
games, and it seems to be something that McKillip has a deep
understanding of.<p>

The characterisation and descriptive writing is also very compelling.
The changing of the tone of writing style with the mood of the
narrative, which many people comment on in her work, is again present,
and is very effective in creating atmosphere.  And it is atmosphere
which again is one of the strongest elements drawing the reader: the
book is very readable, and the resolution of the plot is quite
satisfying.  Many elements are sharply defined, in bold colours,
whilst others are conveyed much more subtly, and McKillip shows the
range of writing she is capable of fairly clearly.<p>

In conclusion, this is a book well worth reading; highly enjoyable,
and an excellent introduction to the writer, for those who have not
yet read any of her work.<p>



<hr><a name="halloffa"><h2>CUSFS Hall of Fame 1991-92</h2></a>

<h3>Philippa Hogben</h3>

There were 19 entries to the Hall of Fame which is a pityingly small
proportion of the society so don't blame me if your favorites didn't
appear in the list, you should have voted.  The points were allocated
as normal with 20 points going to the first choice in each category
down to 11 points for the 10th placed choice.  Any entry with only one
vote was ignored in the final reckoning.  The Chairbeing wishes to
point out that she is neither fallible nor omniscient.  Any illegible
entries were therefore ignored.<p>

Collating the Hall of Fame actually gave me a very interesting insight
into the way CUSFS members' minds work (or at least chug along giving
the impression of working), apart from the sheer soul destroying
frustration of trying to decipher some people's hand writing!.  It was
amusing to note how many entries got votes in both the best author/
novel/programme categories <em>and</em> the trash category - sometimes
by the same person. Although I allowed fantasy works and authors (not
<em>strictly</em> sf) some people have very odd definitions of science
fiction. Most of these extraneous definitions I simply ignored. If you
had seen what I had to type in you would forgive me.<p>

Final disclaimer... any mistakes are mine, all mine.<p>

<cite>Dr. Who</cite> made a valiant attempt but was unable to knock
<cite>Blake's 7</cite> off its pedestal.  The votes of those people
who can't tell the difference between the television and radio
versions of <cite>Hitch&#173;Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</cite> have
been split evenly between the two versions. This has probably made the
television version appear higher up the list than it deserves but the

<hr><a name="onthebac"><h2>"On the Back of the University"</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Arrowsmith</h3>


"As you may be aware, we are experiencing a certain amount of
difficulty with the University at the moment.  Alright, I'll be honest
with you, we have a major problem on our hands.  The entire system,
more or less, has gone down.  You probably noticed things were a
little strange on your way here; indeed, I believe finding this room
was something of a problem.  The thing is, you see, over the past
centuries more and more of the University has become
system&#173;dependent, starting with, naturally enough, the
administrative aspect of things.  This has been known to cause
problems, but no more than any conventional bureaucracy would
experience.  Then, however, we began to shift part of the very fabric
of the Colleges and Departments into the program, and this has
resulted in the chaos you are now experiencing, instead of what should
have been relatively few side effects of a rather minor crash.<p>

"It appears that the problem originated somewhere in the Computer
Laboratory, with an AI experiment that slipped past local security.
It was removed from the network as soon as possible, but it had left
serious damage in its wake that was not at first apparent.  Then a
relatively minor request through the system from one of the
mathematics Societies was routed through a post that had been left
non&#173;existent by the rogue AI.  This somehow worked its way up the
system, until it failed to find the Vice&#173;Chancellor, due to the
fact that the request had been misdirected by the previous empty
positions, at which point emergency shut&#173;down systems were
operated, over&#173;riding operator&#173;intervention.<p>

"The situation now is that we have to reset the University.  There is
a small button in the Senate House basement for precisely this
purpose.  However, there are one or two snags.<p>

"Basically, they all stem from the fact that there hasn't actually
been a University re&#173;boot for over seven hundred years.  All
subsequent updates to the system have been carried out on the fly,
and, in fact, have been written in increasingly more advanced
languages.  The original source is a self&#173;defining language known
as TROG, and although we can still compile and run it, it has become
obsolete, and no&#173;one knows how to use it anymore.  We will thus
be unable to modify the source in any way, and will be unable to trap
any bugs resulting from the changes to the operating environment since
the last time the system was run.<p>

"The most fundamental of these changes, of course, has been the
expansion of the University.  The initial conditions specified only
three Colleges and four Departments, and a system&#173;reset will
cancel all existing sites and install just these seven and the Senate
in their place.  Fortunately, we have been taking tape back&#173;ups
of all the Colleges and Departments at regular intervals, mainly for
ease&#173;of&#173;maintenance purposes.  It should be possible to get
all the Colleges and the major Departments back up and running within
forty&#173;eight hours of a re&#173;boot, the re&#173;boot itself
taking in excess of twenty hours.  Given that we will have to do a
thorough check for problems on the newly re&#173;installed system, it
is likely to take over a week before things are anything like back to
normal, and even then there will probably still be the odd fault
reported from time to time.<p>

"I see no reason, however, why the student time&#173;table should be
altered while the work is in progress."<p>



<hr><a name="nelsonsc"><h2>Nelson's Column</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

It was 9.03am.  It was overcast.  The morning calm was broken by the
sound of the latest Kylie Minogue single, blaring from the open doors
of Mr Burger.  An obscene, swaying, balloon&#173;like figure
threatened to topple from the roof, its greasy brown fingers and inane
grin beckoning all to sample the delights to be found inside.
Curiously enough, the building had only been there for three
minutes.<p>

This was no surprise to the only inhabitant of the BBC gravel pit, a
small rodent the technicians had taken to feeding; it had seen it all
before, and was rather blas&eacutre; about the whole affair.<p>

An eccentric figure hunched over the controls of the TARDIS, his
clothing the result of a BBC costume assistant let loose in Oxfam.
Finally, with a triumphant stab at a large red button, the floor shook
and the viewscreen came on, to reveal the shiny plastic and metal
tubing of a BBC set designer's hangover.<p>

The control room was suddenly filled with a gratingly
high&#173;pitched squeal, and the Doctor finally spoke.  "Mel, how
many times have I told you not to use the intercom?  Last time, you
managed to shatter the navigation system; we were stuck in Benidorm
for a fortnight!  And will you please try to get rid of that American
accent; when I gave you Peri's brain, I thought it would be an
improvement!"<p>

The doors of the TARDIS opened; the Doctor and Mel stepped out into
the spotless and gleaming interior of Mr Burger; an effect possible
only by polishing the surfaces with Coca Cola.  Mel ordered a Huge
Whopper with Cheese and a strawberry Triple Thick Shake, while the
Doctor started taking measurements of one of the tables with a steel
ruler.  Half an hour later, a soggy cardboard box and a crumbling
pinkish lump arrived at the table.  The lump had a straw sticking out
of it.  "Doctor, there's something very strange about that waitress; I
mean, the plumber's mate I can understand, but the egg whisk is a bit
odd... aaagh!"<p>

A honey&#173;smooth voice made itself known.  "So Doctor, we meet
again!  Oops, wrong villain."  The owner of the voice, wearing a
neatly trimmed beard and a chef's apron, stepped up to the table.  "I
see you've discovered my latest scheme: to destroy England with
burgers indistinguishable from the baps or the cardboard packaging!
You have walked straight into my trap!  Ha ha ha!"  With that, he
tapped an lengthy code into the till register and the BBC gravel pit
outside disappeared, to the vague disinterest of a small rodent.<p>

"Hold on," said the Doctor, rushing outside, "that corridor looks
familiar!"  Within moments, he had emerged from the blue box that was
the TARDIS, sitting incongruously amid the plastic tables.  "You
idiot," he shouted.  "You've nested them; we'll never get back now!"
To prove his point, he ran outside again and re&#173;emerged from the
TARDIS, banging his shin on the way.  "But why?"<p>

Suddenly the Master ripped off his apron, and grinned horribly.  "Hold
on," said the Doctor, "I know that face... no, you can't be..."<p>

"I'm afraid so, Doctor; it's a useful disguise.  I've been able to
hide among these primitive Earth people for years, playing practical
jokes on them and making television programmes about it.  You see the
hidden camera in that dalek?"<p>

The dalek trundled forward, then stopped two feet away.  The top
slowly unscrewed, and a well&#173;known figure stepped out carrying a
large red book.  "You thought you were here to play a trick on yet
another member of the public, didn't you?  Well, Jeremy Beadle, THIS
IS YOUR LIFE!"<p>


The Doctor sidled quietly away, considering how to extricate the
TARDIS from its current predicament.  "Now if we reverse the polarity
of the neutron flow..."<p>



<hr><a name="milklake"><h2>The Milk Lakes of Thrace</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

The desert city of Thrace is very proud of its lakes, and with good
reason.  If you make the journey there (three weeks by camel, in any
direction), you might find the citizens unwilling to tell you about
them; they're suspicious of foreigners, and highly protective.<p>

Naturally, this is an attitude the government of Thrace has tried to
encourage in its citizens from a very early age; there are public
holidays and classes on the lakes' importance to life in the desert.
As any child could tell you (but never will), the lakes provide the
city's chief source of nutrition: a constant supply of milk, which the
government pumps up to the city free of charge.<p>

The citizens are happy to use this versatile food in all sorts of
local dishes; there's even an annual competition for the best recipe
(rewarded with extra milk rations for a month), and the master chefs
work on their creations for months before the festival, guarding their
simmering vats with great care, lest their rivals get an advance
tasting.<p>

The lakes also provide a source of income for the city; surplus milk
is taken across the desert by caravan, and helps the government pay
for many civic schemes, including free schools and public parks with
decorative rock arrangements.<p>

Thrace has no unemployment problem, like some of the cities in the
desert; the government always needs people to work on the lakes.  It's
quite an honour among the city's misfits and social outcasts to be
picked for the milk skimmers.  Sadly, workers can never come back to
the surface (the mortality rate is high, and there are never enough
workers in the caves), but this is considered a small price, to help
society.<p>

When a new worker is led through the maze&#173;like tunnels beneath
the city to the well&#173;guarded lakes (the government can't afford
the risk of sabotage by enemy agents), he is greeted with warm
affection by his fellow workers, eager for tales from the surface.<p>

The worker will be assigned to a skimmer team, getting used to the
simple routine of working, eating and sleeping in the flat skiff that
will be home for the rest of his working life.  In their work hours,
the skimmers will travel the lakes looking for undisturbed patches,
where they can skim the nutritious surface layer, the cream, for
processing and pumping up to the city above.<p>

After a few weeks, most workers settle into their new lives.  Some,
however, seem unable to accept the claustrophobia, or the risk of
death by fire (the gas given off by unprocessed milk is very volatile,
and can ignite accidentally).  A few try to escape, and get lost in
the extensive tunnel system.  This loss is regretted by the
government, which is why they have recently written the following
slogan to help workers forget their previous lives: "IN THRACE,
NO&#173;ONE CAN HEAR YOU CREAM"<p>



<hr><a name="apocalyp"><h2>Apocalypse Peril of the Singularity
Invaders from Space</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

"Holy Cow, they're coming from the Black Holes!  Flee for your lives!"
It was true - even as he spoke there poured from the singularities
around fertile Nexus like silverfish washed out of a hole in the
skirting&#173;board a vast armada, a spacefleet, a giant interstellar
herd of enormous Space Walruses, their hides gleaming in the reflected
light of a million suns, their cosmic tusks a thousand miles long
crackling with salival sparks and sharper than the coldest frost,
their evil eyes tight in folds of steel&#173;hard skin fixed greedily
at the garden world they planned to suck dry.  Who knew what dark
emptiness these inconceivable walruses had come from, nor how long
they had travelled, jumping through trackless spacefrom singularity to
singularity like fleas from dog's back to dog's back until at last
they reached a world which men called home.  What could stop them now?
Their vast tufts of whiskers rippling in the atom&#173;breeze from the
sun, they closed in on their defenceless prey.  Nexus was doomed.<p>

But wait, what was this?  Charging out of the light of the sun,
wringing every inch of speed from the dynamic engines of his
clapped&#173;out old space freighter, who was it but EGIL VANATAR come
to save the world.  His cargo hold was full of extremely powerful TNT!
Without any thought but for the duty he must do, he smashed his
careening spacecraft into the very dead centre of the ravening herd.
And as they all exploded together, spaceship, every last walrus and
Egil Vanatar, he shouted his dying words above the blast, "At last, at
last, I have expiated my terrible crime!" and on the surface of Nexus
ever after on Egilsday children said a special prayer and lonely
people wept to themselves in their rooms for the heroism of one
man.<p>

<!-- Begin archive.txt -->

This page will eventually index past announcements, events, committee lists, and so forth, dating from 2013 onwards.

For older information, see the old version (199X - 2013) of this site <a href="old/index.html">here.</a> It will mostly be of interest to former members, but if you're interested in the society's past it can be quite fun rifling through the pages. If you find something you think should be on the main site, <a href="committee">let the committee know.</a>

<h1>Library</h1>

<p>The society is proud to own an extensive - on the order of several thousand items - collection of science fiction and fantasy novels, anthologies, reference materials, and so forth. We're pretty sure this is one of the largest dedicated SFF collections in the country, and it's free for all members.</p>

<p>The library is opened occasionally during term. Announcements as to opening times will go out on the mailing list; they will also appear on the website.

	<!--The library is located in the basement of the Central Sciences Library on the New Museum Site. Usually we meet by the lift on the ground floor. All you have to do to borrow or return books is come along and the librarian will let you in; just make sure the librarian (or whoever is in charge) makes a note of everything you take out or return. There is a notebook which lives in the library for this purpose.</p>

<p>We're always looking to expand our collection. If you have any suggestions for books we should buy, don't hesitate to <a href="committee">let us know</a>. Better yet, if you've got any relevant material you're looking to get rid of, we happily accept donations and we'll give you free membership in return. Our collection covers the classics very well, but is somewhat lacking in more modern material, so donations in this vein are greatly appreciated indeed. We're also making inroads into a DVD collection, and there are plans to acquire communal board games and such. So, basically, whatever it is you're planning on suggesting or donating, as long as it's in some way relevant (or, occasionally, in no way relevant - e.g. the volume of Byron's poetry), odds are we'll accept it.</p>-->

<p>Very soon there will be a catalogue here. Until then, please bear with us. </p>

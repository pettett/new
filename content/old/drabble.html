<h3>Message from the melodious Meadkeeper</h3>
<p>
To the assembled membership of CUSFS and the Jomsvikings of Jomsborg the New, may I first offer a congratulations for both the quantity and quality of the entries to the drabble competition. Twas an epic task to pick from the assorted works a winner but luckily with the aid of our glorious Reeve and Chairbeing it has now been done.<br>

But before I get on to the winner I shall first offer an honourable mention to our runner up, Identity by Ray Webster. However our winner, to whom a bottle of Norfolk Mead has already been presented last Sunday, was Eternity by William Brooks. Both drabbles follow for your perusal but once again thank you to all who took part and my fellow judges for making the competition a success it was.
</p>
<p>
Your Meadkeeper, Edward Morland

<h3>Identity</h3>
<p>
I'm sure I'm not the only one to have thought of this, but all this talk of robots and androids and replicants has got me thinking.
</p>
<p>
Am I human?
</p>
<p>
I mean, I watch the spaceball on the TV, and I read the man's magazine, but does that make you human? Can a robot appreciate a home run or an ass?
</p>
<p>
Of course not. A robot cares not for his fellow men.
</p>
<p>
Then again, I don't, sometimes. There's a man in the flat above who plays loud spacerock at all hours.
</p>
<p>
I wish he'd die like the flawed creature he is.

<h3>Eternity</h3>
<p>
I finally had the watch of ages in my palm. It weighed heavy in my hand, as destiny weighed on my mind. With a turn of the dial I could halt the flow of time and do as I pleased.
</p>
<p>
I walked out into a street and turned it. Everything halted. A pigeon hovered perfectly still while  cyclists halted, impossibly balanced. I tried to turn my head, but not even my eyes could move.
</p>
<p>
Frozen in time, realisation kicked in. I couldn't restart time. A single vision burnt into my eyes for eternity. An eternity alone with my thoughts. Forever.

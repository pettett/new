<h3>Message from the melodious Meadkeeper</h3>
<p>
To the assembled membership of CUSFS and the Jomsvikings of Jomsborg the New, may I first offer a congratulations for both the quantity and quality of the entries to the drabble competition. Twas an epic task to pick from the assorted works a winner but luckily with the aid of our glorious Reeve and Chairbeing it has now been done.<br>

But before I get on to the winner I shall first offer an honourable mention to our runner up, Identity by Ray Webster. However our winner, to whom a bottle of Norfolk Mead has already been presented last Sunday, was Eternity by William Brooks. Both drabbles follow for your perusal but once again thank you to all who took part and my fellow judges for making the competition a success it was.

<p>
Your Meadkeeper, Edward Morland

	<h1 align="center">TTBA - the CUSFS magazine</h1>

	<p>TTBA is the CUSFS magazine, produced as often as the available contributions and the time and energy
		of the Editor permit. It provides a home for original fiction, reviews and opinion pieces in the
		fields of science fiction and fantasy. Contributions are accepted (very gratefully!) from CUSFS
		members and non-members alike.</p>

	<p>Each issue of TTBA is provided free to charge to <a href="member.html">CUSFS members</a> and
		contributors. Current and back issues are also available for sale to non-members.</p>

	<p>TTBA was first produced in 1974, under the title <cite>Title To Be Announced</cite>. Eventually the
		search for a fixed title was abandoned, and the Editors' creative impulses were given free reign in
		finding bizarre and amusing titles with the initials TTBA. There is an extensive
		<a href="ttba/index.html">archive</a> of TTBA material, with (as at November 2001) an almost complete
		list of titles, a contents listing up to and including Volume 21 (1994/5), and a selection of back
		issues from the early 1990s.

Commented out 24/4/02: Dan has stepped down as editor, and the site listed has not been developed
further.

<p>Dan Sheppard, the current (November 2001) Editor, has set up an additional
<a href="http://ttba.colondot.net/">TTBA site</a>. As at November 2001, this is still under
development, but it is hoped to have a substantial amount of online content here.</p>

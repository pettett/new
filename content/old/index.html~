<h2>
Next meeting: *-ocracy, Sunday 6 February, 7:30pm, Sidney Sussex
</h2>
<p>
Science fiction and, of course, fantasy, are full of fictional societies, many of which choose to run themselves (or are run) in strange ways. Sometimes this is an interesting thought experiment, otherwise it's just the author wishing that some group of which they are usually a member (military veterans, scientists, people from Sweden...) ran the world, and sometimes it's a bit of both!<br>
What's the most interesting form of government you've read about? Can you have an undemocratic utopia? Are AI rulers necessarily a bad (or good) thing? Do we need elections if people can read minds? Could genetic engineering/magic result in a hereditary monarch who actually is the best person for the job? Can democracy survive the introduction of superhumans?
</p>
<p>
To discuss these and many other questions and get wildly off-topic, come to this week's CUSFS meeting on Sunday at 7.30 pm. The meeting will be at the usual time and place &mdash; meet at 7.30, outside Sidney Sussex (opposite Sainsbury's). We'll then head to R Common Room &mdash; if you don't know how to get there and think you might be late, e-mail Alex (ag552) your number to get mine. We'll be the ones wearing long orange scarves.
</p>

<h3>
CUSFS Lunches: Friday 4 February, 12:45, Alex's room (Emmanuel, G5 Old Court)
</h3>
<p>
This is a chance to meet up with your friends from CUSFS at some time that isn't a meeting, and have a picnic lunch. Alex will provide various sandwich ingredients, biscuits, etc.
</p>
<p>
To get to Alex's room, come into Emmanuel via the Porters' Lodge and leave the court your find yourself in by the far right-hand corner. Immediately turn right (there should be a sign saying "Library"). You will be walking along with an old brick building to your right and a large area of grass to your left. Alex's room is on the second staircase you come to in said old brick building &mdash; his name is on the wall at the bottom of the staircase.</br>
 If you think you are likely to get lost, e-mail Alex (ag552) with your phone number to get his. If you plan to come and have any special dietary requirements other than being vegetarian (the food will be veggie-friendly anyway), please tell Alex.
</p>

<h2>
PICOCON 2011
</h2>
<p>
Picocon is the annual one-day Science Fiction & Fantasy convention run by the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, ICSF. It usually takes place on a Saturday in February, in Imperial College's Student Union. We try not to clash with other conventions around the same time.<br>
It is a small (hence the name), affordable and convenient convention for students and fans in or near London. Registration opens at 10am, with the first scheduled events kicking off at around 10:30. The schedule concludes in the evening. At a Picocon you will encounter:<br>
<ul>
<li> Guests of Honour doing talks and panels
<li> The Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise, typically using liquid nitrogen and an enormous hammer. (You're welcome to bring along donations!)
<li> Multiplayer LAN gaming
<li> Stalls selling books, ICSF t-shirts, and other stuff
<li> Quiz and silly games
<li> Student Union bar
</ul>
Entry for students is normally £8, but Alex can get a discount for CUSFS members if I say some are coming. So, please tell him (ag552) if you're planning to go &mdash; also tell him if you are a member planning to go who doesn't have a membership card, especially if you are not a Cambridge student (they tend to take uni cards as proof you're in CUSFS).
</p>

<h2>
Library access
</h2>
<p>
1.30pm on Wednesday. Please email Roseanna (rmp51) if this does not work, or if you need directions or are worried about being late.
</p>
<p>
We have a library in the New Museums site (for a map, look <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/SPL/map.html">here</a>). Here is its <a href="cat.pl">catalogue</a>. Our Glorious Lady Librarian Roseanna is in the library at fairly regular intervals to let people browse, or you can usually persuade her to bring something for you. The regular intervals for this term have not yet been established.
</p>

<h3>
<a href="termplans.html">Term plans</a>
</h3>

<p>CUSFS (and later J&oacute;msborg the New) has been bringing literary
discussion of Science Fiction and Fantasy to students and the general
public in Cambridge since 1963.  Every week during University Full
Term we have a discussion on Sunday evenings, be it on an author, a
theme, or the latest bizarre theory explaining why there's nothing
good on TV anymore.  We tend to alternate between Science Fiction
discussions and Fantasy discussions (which, until 1996, were the
exclusive preserve of J&oacute;msborg).</p>

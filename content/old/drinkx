Various bits of explanation on the CUSFS drinks list...

> Mackeson...
 
Mackeson Milk Stout. A dark stout, like Guinness, but sweet rather than smoky
bitter
 
 
> Cider, Tuborg
>        ^^^^^^
 
Cheap Dutch lager
 
 
> Vimto, Vimto
 
A mixed fruit cordial. Probably blackberry, blackcurrant and orange squash
mixed.
 
Very refreshing drunk hot or cold. Experience - never mix with Polish spirit
vodka, even if you are out of mixers. Vimto stains like blackcurrant
juice.....

Packet of 20 or so paper handkerchiefs

Tasteless drinking snack made from deflavoured corn starch then deep fried in
lard

Vimto is a strange sort of soft drink, I suppose it might be described as
a mix between Cola and cough medicine.

I think they are refering to packets of tissues, you know that contain
about 15 of the jobbies, that you carry around in handbag/pocket/whatever.
Don't know why these might be in a drink though. Perhaps there are
other things called "Handy-andies" that I know not wot of.

A sort of crisp-like snack food: flavoured potatoe thingies.

Once upon a time in Cambridge there was a fast food restaraunt called the
'Whim'.  They were a last resort when you couldn't face another late night
kebab from the kebab shop around the corner. Variously known as Whimbos or
Kangaburgers the products probably contained real meat --- this assumption is
based purely on a vague memory that they were prosecuted on at least one
occasion for using certain varieties of meat more normally associated with
hopping around the Australian outback.
 
As to how many of the drinks have actually been tried. The answer is probably
most of the ones that you might actually want to try and several of the others.
I certainly remember Thursday nights down the 'Horse and Groom' trying out such
things as the Cure for the Common Cold.  The point being that a group of people
clubbed together to pay for all the ingredients and then drank it out of the
same glass so you soon found out if it worked as advertised.
 
What amazes me is that there is only one liquid nitrogen drink in the list (and
probably nobody ever tried that one). Or at least not twice. Virtually every
CUSFS party used to have some liquid nitrogen in the punch.
 
Green lager I'm not positive about, but I think it was lager made by Greene
King breweries.
 
As to the comment someone made about Cam water it wasn't completely deadly. I'm
sure I must have involuntarily swallowed a few mouthfuls the number of times I
fell/was pushed/jumped in.  Just make sure you get your Cam water from well
upstream, definitely not from the lower river.

The green monster *I* know (and love) is made as follows:
 
Insert measure of Vodka.
Insert measure of Bacardi.
Insert measure of Blue Bols.
Fill with cider and orange (or lime).
 
The orange makes the Blue Bols go green.
 
Lager/cider mixes are best put into a "Floating Bogey".
 
1/2 lager
1/2 cider
Baileys
blackcurrent
 
(the Baileys curdles and floats, hence the name).
 
This must be drunk fast, with the record around here being 14 secs. (I managed
18).
 
Have fun.....

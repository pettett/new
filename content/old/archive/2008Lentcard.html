you?'</th>

 <td colspan="3">
Are you sure your neighbour isn't being mind controlled? Is there

         <td colspan="3">
	 While we can all appreciate the effort 
	 and beauty of a well-researched and scientificly accurate work, at the same 
	 time some of the most fondly remembered science fiction is, frankly, rather 
	 silly. What do you think?

	       <th>Dinosaurs</th>

	        </tr>
		  <tr>
		     <td colspan="3">
			   Could future science let us rebuild the dinosaurs, make them 
			   better and stronger than they were before? Could adapted dinosaurs become our 
			   servants - or would it be the other way around?

 <th>March 10th</th>

  <td colspan="3">
  As part of (what I'm informed by older members may be)a CUSFS tradition, 
  this week's meeting will be demonstration (or celebration) of awful science 
  fiction; bring along the worst short story you can bear to read out and 
  I'll award a (cheap) prize to the best (i.e. worst). Alternatively, just 
  turn up to listen, we won't think any less of you, honest.
<br>
  P.S. In order to limit the number of readings of "The Eye of Argon" to at 
  most one; if anyone wishes to read it please e-mail me.

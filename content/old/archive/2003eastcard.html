  <td colspan="5">
Series spread across multiple books have always been common in Science
Fiction and Fantasy, perhaps more so than in mainstream literature.
Is this just sequelitis in the search for a fast buck, or does it say
something about the involved worlds SF&amp;F create that they're worth
revisiting?  Is a story stronger in its own specially-crafted setting,
or does an existing background ease the storytelling process?  What
about series with multiple authors, or Asimov's tendency to shoehorn
all his stories into a single universe, thus creating a post hoc
series?  What is the influence of a sequel-obsessed Hollywood in all
this?

Come and join us for a light-hearted evening of readings. Bring along
anything you want to impress, entertain, edify or amuse us with, or just
come to listen to other people's selections.  (Short extracts of less

  <td>38 Lensfield Rd, Room 9</td>

<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Frederik Pohl is one of the classic giants of the field, winner of
three Hugos and two Nebulas.  Amongst his masterpieces are the seminal
and bestselling <cite>Gateway</cite> (first book of the Heechee quartet), the
award-winning look at human nature in <cite>Man Plus</cite>, and anticapitalist
dystopias including particularly <cite>The Space Merchants</cite> (co-written
with C M Kornbluth).
Pohl's writing manages to explore time, space and the human condition,
while remaining grippingly readable.  Come and argue about his
politics; be persuaded to read some or more of his work; discuss the
value of the collaborations with Kornbluth; compare Pohl's earlier and
later work.  All this and more at 38 Lensfield Rd on Sunday 4th!

<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Terry Pratchett is one of the few SF or fantasy authors whose books
regularly top the best-seller lists. He's best known for his Discworld
series, which currently stands at around 30 books long. So what is it
about his works that makes them such a roaring success? Would you like to
see more of the same or is it time he moved onto something new? Come along
to discuss, discourse and digress.

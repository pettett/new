<th>October 7th</th>
<th>Discussion: Practical Methods for Reaching the Stars</th>
<td>R Common Room, Sidney Sussex</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Space appears a lot in science fiction, but the methods for actually getting there are usually glossed over. We'll take a look at some of the more realistic portrayals space travel, and see what modern science has to say on the subject.
</td></tr>
<tr id="lulz">
<th>October 14th</th>
<th>Discussion: 101 Ways to Kill a Dalek</th>
<td>R Common Room, Sidney Sussex</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Doctor Who was many people's first exposure to science fiction, and with the BBC's revival of the series this promises to be the case for a new generation as well. Come talk about timelords, baddies and police boxes both old and new.
</td></tr>

<tr id="heh">
<th>October 21st</th>
<th>"Showing": War of the Worlds</th>
<td>AA28 Foundress Court, Pembroke</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Come and listen with CUSFS to the excellent radio adaptation of this sci-fi classic, alleged to have caused mass hysteria when first broadcast in America.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<th>October 23rd</th>
<th>Cinema Trip: Stardust</th>
<td>Vue Cinema, Grafton Centre</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
By popular demand, CUSFS shall go and see this promising adaptation of a fantasy story by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman. "In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm."
</td></tr>

<tr id="wiggle">
<th>October 28th</th>
<th>Discussion: Starship Captains</th>
<td>R Common Room, Sidney Sussex</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
There are those who claim that a generation is defined by its Star Trek captain, with societal change reflected in the progression from the cowboyish Kirk to the diplomatic Picard and so on. A starship's captain is at the heart of much space opera, especially on television, and more recently Firefly's screen-filling Malcolm Reynolds has invoked a new interest in the post. Come to CUSFS and talk about starship captains old and new.

<th>MONDAY November 5th, 6:45pm</th>
<th>Fireworks and V for Vendetta</th>
<td>Midsummer Common</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
 Our traditional trip to the annual Cambridge firework display on Midsummer Common, following which those who wish shall watch the excellent and appropriate film, <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/">V for Vendetta</a>; there will be cake and mead.
</td></tr>

<tr id="slither">
<th>November 11th</th>
<th>Discussion: Cyborgs vs. Genetic Engineering</th>
<td>R Common Room, Sidney Sussex</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Many of us will remember cowering in fear from the Terminator, but modern monsters (and heroes) are more likely to be biological creations. How should CUSFS create its next world-conquering army?
</td></tr>

<tr id="science">
<th>November 18th</th>
<th>Discussion: Favourite Short Story, nominations for Hall of Fame, Booksale Books</th>
<td>AA26 Foundress Court, Pembroke</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Short stories have played a crucial part in the development of science fiction, and unlike novels they can be read in their entirety at a meeting (please only bring those which fall into this category; I suggest a maximum length of 5-10 minutes or about 15 pages). So, bring a favourite to discuss, or just come along to listen to some of the best. We will also be taking nominations for this year's CUSFS hall of fame, a list of the best authors, stories etc. in various categories, to be voted on by the society over the next two weeks.
</td></tr>

<tr id="man">
<th>November 25th</th>
<th>Discussion: Practical Methods of Space Combat</th>
<td>R Common Room, Sidney Sussex</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Space, as the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy memorably told us, is really big; noises do not travel there, and enemy spaceships are unlikely to be brightly lit for your convenience. How would an actual space battle go?
</td></tr>

<tr id="twigger">
<th>November 30th 8:30pm</th>
<th>Games Evening, Hall of Fame announcements</th>
<td>Burrell's Field Common Room</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td colspan="3">
Our famous games evening; we shall play a variety of superb games including RoboRally - feel free to bring along your own favourites. We shall also announce the results of voting on this year's Hall of Fame.

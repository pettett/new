<p>The J&oacute;msborg Annual Dinner, the Veizla, will be held on Saturday the 24th
of June, in the Althurston (?) Room, Trinity College.  The dinner proper starts at
7:30pm, but you may be at a disadvantage finding your seat if you have not had a
chance to peruse the puzzle at the mead reception.</p>

<p>There will be a mead reception at 6:45pm, in H2, New Court, Trinity.</p>

<p>The cost of a ticket to the Veizla is &pound;20.50 for non-drinkers, and &pound;27.00
for drinkers.  Please let us know if you are vegetarian.</p>

<p>The menu for the Dinner is:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Stuffed Garlic Mushrooms</li>
 <li>Chicken Supreme Henry IV or Asparagus Pancake Rolls</li>
 <li>Apple and Blackberry Pie with Ice Cream</li>
</ul>

<p>White and red wines will be served with the meal, and there will be port
to conclude.</p>

<p>During the meal the Companions and other Jomsvikings will be asked to meet
the Reeve's Challenge.  As announced last night, the Challenge this year
is Limericks.  Also during the meal will be the announcement of the new
Reeve, and selection of the new Companions.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend, and have not already indicated your interest,
please email the lame duck Chairbeing, Duncan Richer,
indicating whether or not you will be drinking, and whether or not you
would like the vegetarian meal. Places are limited to 20 in all, so
please respond promptly.</p>

<p>The Aftermath of the Veizla will be held at Relativity, 155 Gilbert Road.
It will presumably start some time between 10pm and 10:30pm on Saturday
24th June. Please BYO alcohol etc.</p>

<p>The Summerthing will start, as is traditional, at 12 noon on the day after
the Veizla, namely Sunday 25th June. We meet at Trinity Bridge, and then
head down to Grantchester for a delicious picnic and literary discussion.
The actual topic of the discussion will be announced by the new Reeve on
the night of the Veizla, so there's no point trying to prepare for it.</p>

<p>Of course, to punt down to Grantchester we will actually need some
punts. If you can help provide punts, then let Duncan Richer
know as soon as possible by email, telling him how many
you can provide, and what the cost will be. We'll let everybody know as
soon as possible whether or not their assistance will be required.</p>

<p>If you wish to attend the Summerthing (regardless of whether or not you
are attending the Veizla), then please let us know as soon as
possible. If you would like the committee to organise your part of the
picnic spoils (at a cost of around about &pound;2, and not including any
alcohol), then let us know that as soon as possible as well.</p>

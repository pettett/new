Robert Jordan's <cite>Wheel of Time</cite>: the never-ending story, disaster or delight?
So far there are ten books in the series, and a prequel, and there is no
ending yet in sight! The books are both getting thicker and containing less
and less time within them... will there ever be an ending?! Come and share
why you love them, why you hate them, what you think will happen... any and
all thoughts welcome.<br />

Spoiler policy: People should expect that the discussion will contain
spoilers for at least the early parts of the series. Possibly inaccurate
spoilers, as there is rather a lot to remember...

And so another year of Jómsborg the New ends. Join the Reeve, Companions
and Jómsvikingar in our preparations for the New Year. The Jómsvikingar
purify themselves by staying up throughout the night, helped along by
games, readings, mead, conversation, and anything else that comes to mind.
Oh, and probably a fair amount of coffee. The particularly devout meet on
top of Castle Mound at sunset to bid farewell to the Old Sun, which is due
to finally wind down at 16:43 on the 30th. Distractions will include being
able to actually look at the library sale books (so bring money if you
might be interested in buying any), and the CUSFS reading (see above).

The host of the Jómsvikingar march, as one, to the hub of the Universe
(known simply to mortal folk as the Castle Mound). There, the Reeve,
assisted by the assembled throng and a large quantity of mead, raises the
New Sun, gives it form, and sets it circling for another year. (The
ceremony will start at about 07:25; sunrise is scheduled for 07:42.) We
will try to organise breakfast for those interested (and still awake!)
after the Afmaelisdagr. Even if you do not manage to attend the Wake please
feel free to join us on Castle Mound!

<cite>Farscape</cite> centres on the adventures of the astronaut John
Crichton who is flung through a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy
and forced to battle for survival amidst warring planets, evil empires and
the various conflicting personalities of the escaped prisoners he has
fallen in with.<br />

<cite>Farscape</cite> is one of the new generation of science fiction TV
shows that has emerged in recent years, more concerned with survival in a
hostile and confusing universe than the utopianism of the likes of Star Trek.
It is also notable for its original use of puppetry - two of the main
characters are animatronic puppets. If you enjoyed the likes of <cite>Firefly</cite>,
<cite>Lexx</cite> or <cite>Star Wars</cite> then you'll probably like
<cite>Farscape</cite>. We plan to watch 3-4 episodes per showing, starting
at the beginning of season 1.

This week's discussion focuses on the work of the American science fiction
and fantasy author Carolyn Janice Cherry. Although a prolific writer,
Cherryh is perhaps best known for <cite>Cyteen</cite>, which won the Hugo
Award, and the epic space opera that are the stories of her 'Alliance/Union'
universe. Cherryh's background in psychology, history and languages allows
her to create uniquely alien worlds, in a style often resembling stream of
consciousness. The sheer breadth of her work and this individual style
should make for a lively discussion and interesting evening.

We will be showing the whole of this cult miniseries in one go, with a
break for pizza. <strong>Please turn up around 7:30ish.</strong> If you arrive later
than 8pm you may interrupt the show and/or miss the pizza order, so
don't do that if you can help it. Total runtime is 189 minutes, so we
should be done by midnight.  Please also mail the committee so we

Despite the rather bizarre and enigmatic title, this week's discussion is
merely concerned with portrayals of aliens in television, films, books and
the media. From the Daleks to the computer generated bug-eyed monsters of
recent films, 'aliens' remain an entertaining feature of many classic pieces
of science fiction. Come along and rant about particularly bad stereotypes
or defend your favourite rubber suited extraterrestrial against such

Picocon is a one-day SF convention, run by ICSF, the Imperial College SF and fantasy 
society. The guests of honour this year are Gwyneth Jones, John Courtenay 
Grimwood and Brian Stableford - each of them has a slot in the programme 
where they will talk about something that interests them, and take 
questions from the audience.<br />

There will also be a dealers' room, with second-hand booksellers etc., and 
various events throughout the day. Picocons have included dalek racing, 
quizzes, a LAN games room, juggling lessons and `destruction of dodgy 
merchandise' auctions, among other things. (Note there will be no film 
this year; instead the talks/discussions/etc. will run until later in the 
day.) CUSFS are the current holders of the Imperial/Cambridge/Oxford 
inter-varsity Fish Duelling title, but this year may well see a re-match 
(and truly this is not a sight to be missed!).<br />

Entrance costs £5.00 for students (bring ID) and £7.00 for others. A CUSFS
group will be going to Picocon, by train, travelling on the 09:15 to
King's Cross. If you're interested, please join us at the railway station
(look for the orange scarves) by 9am - this should allow enough time
for buying tickets. (The recommended ticket is the One-Day Travelcard
(about £16), which includes a day return to London and unlimited travel on
the Underground. Discounts are available with Young Person's and Network
Railcards.) If you have lectures on Saturday morning and can't meet us at
Cambridge station, do consider coming along later for the afternoon events
- it's usually a very enjoyable day.

Librarian and TTBA Editor, so if you think you might be interested, contact

officer. Some details of the committee posts are also in the

<i>"Guy Gavriel Kay writes good fantasy." Discuss.</i><br />

Though his output is fairly limited (only 9 novels in 20 years), Kay's work
reveals a richness of content and texture that many other writers might envy.
He handles the lives (and sometimes deaths) of his characters, major and minor,
with great care and not a little sympathy. His control of his own plots, and
those of his characters, is masterful: he has a precise knowledge of the
locations and movements of all the pieces on the board, and adjusts the
tension by careful choice of the order in which their stories are told.
As a former academic, he has an eye for detail and a belief in the need
for thorough research which are matched by very few others; and both these
traits are particularly evident from his recent work (e.g.
<cite>The Lions of Al-Rassan</cite>, <cite>The Sarantine Mosiac</cite>),
set in a world based on the Mediterranean at several different historical
periods. He is also perhaps (in)famous for his work as Christopher Tolkien's
assistant in editing <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> for publication.<br />

Interested? You should be! Come along on Sunday evening. If you've read Kay's
work, talk about what you liked and disliked; if you haven't, discover more about it.

On <a href="#e20050211">11 February</a>, we showed the original <cite>V</cite>
miniseries, in which humanoid aliens arrived on Earth from the sixth planet
of Sirius in fleet of huge saucer ships that park over the major cities of
the planet.<br />

In the second miniseries, <cite>V: the Final Battle</cite>, we will see more
about the activities of the organised resistance - and the plot will
be better completed than at the end of the first series. If you were
at the first showing, do come along (but note the earlier start time,
due to the longer run-time). New viewers are also welcome.<br />

"When the revolution comes...."<br />

Politics and SF have always been bedfellows. From the social commentary of
Wells' Eloi and Morlocks to countless invasions of barely-disguised
Communist Martians, the genre has always been commenting on the political
issues of its day. How has this evolved, and how successful has SF been in
its brushes with politics? Who are the modern political SF writers and what
are the issues that motivate them? With Ken MacLeod and China Mi&eacute;ville
apparently leading a modern science-fictional Left, where is the Right in
modern SF? To discuss these questions and more, vote for CUSFS at 17
Ashworth Park!

The last discussion of this term concerns the works of SF author Larry
Niven. He first won the Hugo Award (for Best Short Story) in 1967 for
<cite>Neutron Star</cite> and has since been awarded it on another 3 occasions.
He has also written scripts for several television shows and a logical fantasy
series detailed in <cite>The Magic Goes Away</cite>. Niven is perhaps best known
though for his Known Space universe (including the Ringworld books) in which
humanity shares several solar systems with various species. Join us for a
discussion of this diverse and interesting author.

For the first time ever, the short-list for the World Science Fiction           
Society's annual Hugo Awards is all-British. So what are we getting             
right? Come along to discuss the impending British take-over of SF and

where the ticket collection posts and food counters are, at 7:40pm (meeting
early to improve our chances of getting good seats). Look out for an
implausibly long orange scarf.</p>

Quartet and the Derkholm series. If you are not familiar with Wynne Jones
then now is as good a time as any to come along and find out more...

This week we will be discussing the art of constructing a convincing world 
in science fiction and fantasy. What makes one landscape or set of 
characters more believable or more attractive than another? How do the 
worlds of television and film compare with those of books? Feel free to bring along 
as many examples (wonderful or terrible) as you see fit ...

<p>Long, long ago* and far, far away**, there lived a race of small pink
knitted people, called the Clangers. Excitable and inquisitive, they enjoyed
discovering and exploring the strange and wonderful things in the Universe
around them. They also had visitors, like the Froglets and the Iron Chicken.
Due to the lack of atmosphere, they lived in subterranean burrows (with the
entrances covered by dustbin lids, of course), which they shared their
friends, including the Soup Dragon.<br />
* the 1970's<br />
** a hitherto undiscovered (very) minor planet</p>

<p>Intrigued? Curious? Nostalgic? Now, thanks to the wonders of modern
technology, CUSFS can help you relive those far-off days! Come along to the
CUSFS Clangers marathon, and uncover the mystery of the blue string
pudding...</p>

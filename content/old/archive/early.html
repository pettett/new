<h2>
The early history of CUSFS, as related by Thomas Goodey, one of the founders.</h2>
I went up in 1963 (St. John's), and of course immediately heard of 
the Freshers' Fair (? or some similar name?). Since I was and am a 
serious SF enthusiast, I decided to start a society. So I got a table 
in the Fair and laid a few old Astoundings out and awaited 
developments. Several like-minded souls approached me, and we all 
pooled our collections to form the nucleus of the Library. 
<p/>
We found a volunteer, in Caius I believe, to host the books, and we 
collected some subscriptions to purchase cheap bookshelves. The 
chap's rooms were opened to members twice a week, Â I think. I 
remember that there were about 60 members initially, and I remember 
the subscription as being 10 shillings, but this information may be 
faulty. Anyway there was enough money left to fill up the collection 
of (British edition) Astoundings back to 1952 or thereabouts, and of 
Galaxy back to #1. We also bought more and more secondhand 
paperbacks, which were pretty cheap. I used to comb Shepherd's Bush 
market in London for them. I remember that I actually shelled out 
quite a bit for a hardcover "Man in the High Castle" which was an 
American edition, impossible to acquire cheaply. It was avidly 
consumed by a succession of members.
<p/>
The Society acquired more and more books, and in my third year (1965-
66) there were about 5000. In that year they were in my rooms (New 
Court), and there wasn't much space left! Anyway, when I left in June 
1966, somebody - I forget who - volunteered to take the Society 
onwards, and there you go - it obviously acquired a life of its own 
which will probably outlast mine!

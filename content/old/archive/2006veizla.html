<p>The Veizla is the annual dinner of Jómsborg the New, and also marks the
inauguration of a new Reeve and Companions. There will be a mead reception
with puzzles and the annual Jómsphoto, followed by dinner (during which
people will be asked to answer the Reeve's Challenge - see below), followed
by port and more mead, and the traditional announcement of the new Reeve and
Companions. Afterwards we are likely to retire for further merriment.</p>

<p>There will be a <strong>mead reception</strong> on Laundress Green (the
large open area, outside the University Centre, accessible via the gate
opposite the Mill) starting at 6pm. There will be puzzles to solve and a
group photograph. The meal will begin at 7pm, in Riverside Rooms 1 and 2.</p>

<p align="center">
Smoked chicken salad, with an endive and apple salad, and avocado dressing<br />

or<br />

Char-grilled courgette and halloumi salad<br /><br />

Oven-baked salmon supreme, baked with cajun spices, and served with herb couscous, roasted courgette and pine nuts<br />

or<br />

<p>During the course of the meal, you will be asked to answer the
<strong>Reeve's Challenge</strong>:</p>

<p>The J&oacute;msvikingar were a group of hard-drinking, hard-fighting mercenaries
terrorising the Norse coasts around the turn of the millennium. Only fragments of
their sagas have come down to us. The J&oacute;msviking-saga describes their
founding and decline, and the Runingawaying-saga describes their eventual defeat
and migration to Albion.</p>

<p>The J&oacute;msvikingar suffered a number of important defeats and were finally
attacked by a joint force with supernatural help, led by Magnus I of Norway, who
razed their stronghold and drove them from Scandinavia. During their last defence
and journey through many perils to their new home in Albion, chronicled in the
Runingawaying-saga, they famously demonstrated all 167 J&oacute;msviking major and
minor virtues.</p>

</p>Now the full text is lost, but many extracts telling of a J&oacute;msviking
showing a particular virtue (courage, impulsiveness, obedience, alcohol tolerance,
cruelty, etc.) in a particular situation (defending a wall, fighting a sea monster,
playing cards, etc.) are preserved as teaching ballads for young J&oacute;msvikingar.</p>

<p>Most have been translated into English, either as prose or verse, though few
nowadays still try to mimic the traditional Norse forms. They range in length from
one couplet to over a hundred lines. Your task is to make up such an extract and
present it at the Veizla.</p>

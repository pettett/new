What do historical science fiction ideas about the present day tell us about
our present and future? <br />

When Asimov invented the positronic brain, he got it wrong. When Clarke
invented things, he got some of it right. When Brunner invented a terrifying
future dystopia where overpopulation is rampant, he got it too right for
comfort. We are living in the Future, where are the wonders promised? Where are
the flights of fancy, the towering heights of the imagination? Where is Thomas
Moore's Utopia? Why do we want the sick joke of a long-dead scholar anyway? To
find the answers to these, and many more questions, come to CUSFS on Sunday.

Play games old, new, silly and sensible with CUSFS! If you have any games you
would like to play, bring them! The games get sillier as the evening wears on,
and this is the ideal anodyne for revision, and handily just after CATAM
submissions. Warning: RoboRally will occur! If you have not previously heard of
this game, prepare for the experience of a lifetime.

<tr>
<td colspan="3">
For centuries, the human race has dreamed of the stars. We send robotic probes
to the far reaches of the solar system, seeking ever greater scientific
knowledge. Our great telescopes gaze endlessly across the vasty deep of
interstellar space, seeking answers in the void. Man, by his god-given genius
of Science, has at last succeeded in penetrating further and further into the
vast unknown of Space. Men have walked on the moon. We plan a permanent presence
there, a moonbase, and to visit Mars. But why?

This Friday is May 25th , otherwise known as International Towel Day.<br/>
On this day, in memory of Douglas Adams, hitchhikers everywhere carry their
towels with them wherever they go. Since Adams was a Cambridge man, we are
pleased to joing this tradition, and thus I heartily encourage you:<br/>
Wear your towel on Friday!<br/>
Another CUSFS lunch, involving as usual food and things of that nature. In
addition, those attending should wear their towels. Anyone not doing so may
well be mocked, as being insufficiently hoopy.

<th>Discussion: How to come up with a good science fiction title</th>

<tr>
<td colspan="3">
<p>At the recent Hugo winners discussion, it was noted that the Hugo voters
occasionally seemed to be giving the award to the finalist with the best title.
It takes but one small step of bad logic to conclude that a good title will win
you a Hugo. Accordingly, CUSFS will attempt to enlighten you on this important
topic.</p>

<p>We will discuss the role of rhetoric:<br/>
"If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?"<br/>
of semantics:<br/>
"The Word for World is Forest"<br/>
of extravagance:<br/>
"Zirn Left Unguarded, the Jenghik Palace In Flames, Jon Westerley Dead!"<br/>
of being Scientific:<br/>
"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones"<br/>
and of precision:<br/>
"Adrift Just Off the Islets of Langerhans: Latitude 38° 54' N, Longitude 77° 00' 13" W"</p>

<p>We will also consider the importance of backing up your excellent title with a
suitable blurb:</p>

<p>SCIENCE AGAINST MAN (1971)</p>
<p>Ten years ago a collection such as this would have been a series of
technological nightmares - crazy robots, poisoned wastelands, megalomaniac
computers, mega-death dealing microbes and warheads. ... Today
these nightmares are no longer the preserve of the science fiction writer. They
are part of our daily lives.</p>

for a civilised game (or two) of croquet to decide the fate of the candidates for CUSFS
Vice-President-hood. Please bring some suggestions for beings, concepts or objects which
you feel merit the chance to be enshrined forever in CUSFS history (and Captain CUSFS
cartoons). Flamingos will be provided.

Are you the seventh son of a seventh son? It's probably about time you
set out to seek your fortune, then. Grab your knapsack, jump on your
horse, and come to CUSFS to find out who and what you might meet on your
way. We will appraise the literature available to guide you on your way
and discuss the dos and don'ts of dragon-fighting and wizard etiquette.

<h1>J&oacute;msborg Missive</h1>

<h2>Lewis Carroll &THORN;&iacute;ng - 18 November 2001</h2>

<pre>             Matthew said 'The
          time's near, We'll
        have finished
      the beer; When
     the drinking
      is done, I'll
         have nothing
           to do.' 'When
              you've finished
              the barrel, come
                talk about
               Carroll, or
           Dodgson,' said
         Peter, 'to
      name him for
     true.' For a
    Jomsborgish
      Thing is
        a treat
           for a
            king, so
            an emperor
           surely
        can't let
      it go by.
    And the
   Wonderland
    writer 
      made
        many
         hearts
        lighter -
       though all
         snarks
           were
            Boojums,
             I'd
           fear
         not
        to
         try!
</pre>

Many thanks to Matthew Woodcraft.

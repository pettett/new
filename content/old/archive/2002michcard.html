  <td colspan="5">
First broadcast in 1984, <cite>The Caves of Androzani</cite> is Peter Davison's
swan-song in the role of the Doctor, and regarded by many as one of
the best stories produced by the TV series.  A sense of
ever-increasing doom, a host of interesting characters, and among the
best `Doctor Who' cliff-hangers ever make for a slick story that
entertains, frightens, and deserves re-watching again and again.  Come
and join us at 11 Atherton Close at 8:00 for pre-video coffee, with the
showing starting at 8:30.<br />

A walking party will leave from in front of the Round Church on Bridge
Street at 7:30pm (but don't worry, it doesn't take half an hour to walk
there!) - look out for the orange scarves.

on the night. The bonfire will start with 5 tonnes of wood."<br />

Well, it's that time again, and CUSFS is organising an outing to the Grafton
Fireworks on Midsummer Common.  Meet outside the Fort St. George pub at 7:00
prompt in time for finding a good place before the fireworks start at 7:30.
Look for the orange scarves!  (Latecomers will be unlikely to find us.  You
have been warned...)<br />

It is likely that we will head for the Castle Inn for warming drinks
afterwards.

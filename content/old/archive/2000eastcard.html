It's been a little over 20 years since <cite>The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the
Galaxy</cite> was launched on unsuspecting radio-listening, literary and
eventually television-watching public.  Does its bizarre style of
surrealist and/or absurdist humour stand the test of time, or does it lose
something on subsequent re-readings?  Was <cite>Mostly Harmless</cite> an unnecessary
extension to the classic Trilogy of Four Parts?  Has anyone been to the
room in St John's in which parts of the Dirk Gently series were set?  All
these and many similar questions will hopefully be asked (and maybe even
answered) at this discussion.

<p>Juliet McKenna, author of <cite>The Thief's Gamble</cite>, <cite>The Swordsman's Oath</cite>, and
<cite>The Gambler's Fortune</cite>, will be coming to talk about her experiences as an
author.  Please come along, either to ask questions or just to find out
more.  Here's a snippet - her own comments on <cite>The Thief's Gamble</cite>, as
reproduced on Amazon:</p>

<p>"I wrote this book because I was wondering if anyone else wanted to read
fantasy with characters who had lived lives of their own, whose personal
concerns were at least as important to them as whatever epoch-shaking
events they might be caught up in. On a purely personal level, I was also
finding much of the fantasy I was reading unrealistic; I know that sounds
like a contradiction in terms, but think about it for a moment. Other
things I was getting tired of included heroines who went through their
adventures untouched by human hand until ending up as the hero's reward in
the final chapter, and even more so farm boys who turned out to be
princes (unaccountably mislaid) or wizards (hugely powerful but not
wishing to take over the world on account of being such darn nice guys)
without anyone realising. Some writers can tell these tales extremely well,
but I was finding a limit to what even the most inventive author could
bring to the traditional hero tale. I wanted to write about a world where
things like politics, religion and sex are facts of everyday life, rather
than cosmos-shaping forces. After studying history at school, university
and latterly just out in interest, I wanted a fantasy world where there is
change, progression, advances in science and technology, literature and
philosophy, where the world goes on its way quite independently of
whatever it is that has the wizards and heroes running around in circles. The
more I worked on it, the more the ideas came together and <cite>The Thief's
Gamble</cite> was the result."</p>

General Meeting of the Science Fiction Society.  Come along and see the
new Committee being elected, join in the ludicrous election of our six new
Permanent Vice-Presidents, and then spend the rest of the evening playing
various bizarre games, both SF and non-SF.</p>

<p>If you're interested in any committee post, please come along;  the
committee consists of a Chairbeing, Secretary, Junior Treasurer,
Membership Secretary, Librarian and TTBA Editor, plus other positions
co-opted on as necessary (including this year a Minutes Secretary).</p>

(I read from the back of the box...)<br />
David Cronenberg presents the near future: eXistenZ is the ultimate game,
brianchild of the hip, hyper and sexually alluring Allegra Geller (Jennifer
Jason Leigh). Once downloaded via a bioport implanted into the players'
spine, eXistenZ promises an experience that will shatter forever the line
between fantasy and reality.<br />
At its launch armed fanatics burst in, determined to destroy the game and
its creator. Forced to run for her life, Allegra's sole ally is a young
security guard (Jude Law). Together they seek refuge in the only place the
gaming goddess feels safe - the world where existence ands and eXistenZ
begins.

  <td colspan="5">
With nine books published under the name Robin Hobb, and nine books under
the name of Megan Lindholm, this is an author with a fast growing
reputation. The Robin Hobb books are divided into three trilogies and can be
described as epic fantasy. Megan Lindholm is harder to pin down with novels
ranging from urban/contempory fantasy (<cite>Wizard of the Pigeons</cite>)
to science fiction (<cite>Alien Earth</cite>). If you wish to know "whence
comes the Fool and why?" (and also why you should care), come along and
discuss her work.<br />

Short story by Megan Lindholm available online:

His novels have only been on book shelves for ten years but he's made a big

action sequences and multi-layered characters, and his alien races have won
him much praise. Come and discuss this British star whether you love him,
hate him or just want to know more.

Afterwards we will head to the Chairbeing's house to enjoy
mulled wine, other hot beverages and toffee apples.

Forget <cite>Angel</cite> and <cite>Buffy</cite>: <cite>Firefly</cite> is
the show Joss Whedon always wanted to make.  Inspired by the Battle of
Gettysburg and the Reconstruction Era of the American Civil War,
<cite>Firefly</cite> is the story of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his
ragtag crew on the rogue Firefly class starship, Serenity, and their
struggle to stay alive in the wake of a galactic civil war 500 years in
the future. Sadly only fifteen episodes were made, but CUSFS has them
and we'll be showing them on Wednesdays until the end of term.<br />

<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Ursula le Guin is probably best known for the fantasy classic
<cite>A Wizard of Earthsea</cite>. On the other hand, her soft,
sociologically-centred science fiction has won many awards, including
for notable works such as <cite>The Left Hand of Darkness</cite> and
<cite>The Dispossessed</cite>. More recently le Guin has developed
a more anthropological style.<br />

If you haven't discovered Ursula le Guin, come and find out why you
should. If you have, come and help answer: is Earthsea really her
best work?  Do we prefer the earlier or later SF? Is she primarily
feminist, anthropologist, or something else? What really makes her
writing stand out?

Bring along a short piece of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature (either
a (very!) short story, or an extract from something longer - no more than 4
or 5 pages is a good rule of thumb) to scare, impress, edify or entertain
the company. Introduce us to someone new, or convert us to an old favourite.
Alternatively, come to listen to what others have brought to read, and be
enlightened, amused, horrified, or just confused.

  <td>Selwyn, Cripps Court, room J1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Science fiction and technology have always been closely linked.  From the
earliest days, SF has tried to extrapolate from the science and the
technology of its time, authors' invention untrammeled by mere practicality.
But yesterday's SF is often tomorrow's technology, perhaps no more so than
now with the appearance of genetics, nanotechnology, computing and even
commercial space travel.  How much has SF influenced science and technology
in the real world, and how much is SF a literary child of the scientific age?
Come along to Cripps
Court at 7:30pm.  Or at a pinch you could take the space elevator.

  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>155 Gilbert Road</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Far from being kids' stuff, work based around fairy stories and traditional
folklore themes forms a very active sub-genre of fantasy. Many of today's
great fantasy writers have turned their hands to retellings of tradional
stories, often working them into more modern settings, or revealing hidden
depths and motivations in their characters. So what is it that brings
writers and readers alike back to the stories that everyone knows? Come and
join CUSFS as we discuss the best way to keep an old tale fresh. We will be
celebrating the last discussion of term with mince pies and mulled wine and
(in keeping with the theme) fairy cakes. There may be an expedition to the
bottom of the garden if weather permits.

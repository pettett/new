Unless you have been very lucky, or living in Mongolia for the last
year and a bit, you cannot fail to have noticed that J. R. R. Tolkien's
<cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> has just been made into a major film
trilogy. Having recently had the opportunity to see the film with CUSFS,
now come along and say you loved it, hated it, couldn't
see what the hype was about, or wish stuffy Oxford dons wrote things
that interesting all the time. We may drift on to Tolkien's other
works too, in case you read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and thought LoTR
to be just too long to bother with.

  <td colspan="5">
Bring along a favourite short piece of Science Fiction and Fantasy
Literature.  Share your tastes with the company, whether it's
something obscure that you want other people to hear, or something
popular you just think is a perfect example of the writer's art, or if
it's just funny or horribly bad!<br />
Alternatively, come to listen to what others have brought to read, and
be enlightened, amused, horrified, or just confused.

And so another year of J&oacute;msborg the New ends. The Reeve, Companions
and all true J&oacute;msvikingar purify themselves by staying up throughout
the night, helped along by a selection of games, reading, sparkling
conversation, and anything else that comes to mind. Oh, and probably a fair
amount of coffee.<br />
And then in the morning...

  <td colspan="5">
The host of the J&oacute;msvikingar march, as one, to the hub of the Universe
(known simply to mortal folk as the Castle Mound). There, the Reeve, assisted
by the assembled throng, raises the Sun, and sets it circling for another year.<br />
Breakfast will be organised for those interested (and still awake!) after the
Afmaelisdagr.<br />
NB. As all true J&oacute;msvikingar know, the Afmaelisdagr falls on 31 January,
the first day of J&oacute;msborg's year. And so it will this year too. For 
complex and arcane reasons, the relevant period has fallen out of the normal
temporal sequence this year.

<a href="http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/icsf/social/events/picocon.html">Picocon</a>
is a one-day SF convention, run by ICSF, the Imperial College SF and
fantasy society. The guests of honour this year are Anne Gay, China
Mieville, Stan Nicholls and Geoff Ryman - each of them has a slot in the
programme where they will talk about something that interests them, and take
questions from the audience. There will also (almost certainly) be a
dealers' room, with more second-hand books than the mind can safely
comprehend. Entrance costs &pound;5.00 for students (with ID!) and &pound;8.00 for others.<br />
A CUSFS group will be going to Picocon, by train, travelling on the 09:15 to
King's Cross. If you're interested, please join us at the railway station
(look for the orange scarves) by 9am - this should allow enough time for
buying tickets. The recommended ticket is the One-Day Travelcard (about
&pound;15), which includes a day return to London and unlimited travel on the
Underground. Discounts are available with Young Person's and Network
Railcards.<br />
Railways and Underground permitting, we should be at South Kensington
Underground station at about 10:40, to reach the IC Students' Union in good
time for the start of the programme at 11:00.

Huge swords, vast battles, and the hewing of enemies put the hack into hack

do you find it distasteful and unnecessary?  Come along to discuss battle
and bloodshed in fantasy and your favourite gory weaponry.  Leave axes at

Whether you love it, loathe it, or simply don't think about it very much,
Star Trek has influenced people's views of Sci-Fi over the last thirty
years.  So come and talk about the series, the films, the spin-offs, the
aliens, the characters, the acting, the politics, and anything else you can
think of.  Was it the first exposure you had to Sci-Fi which turned you on
to the genre, or do you think that the world of Sci-Fi would be better if
Trek had never existed?

  <td colspan="5">
Juliet E. McKenna is a relative newcomer to the fantasy scene, with
<cite>The Warrior's Bond</cite>, the fourth book in her five-book series "The
Tales of Einarinn", published towards the end of 2001. Are the tales of
Livak, the gambler and thief who gets caught up in the affairs of
Archmages and princes and Ryshad the sworn man examples of the best in
new fantasy fiction, or just novel re-cycling of the usual genre
tropes?<br />
Juliet came to speak to the Society in the recent past about the
trials and tribulations of getting one's fantasy fiction published as
a new author. Come and discuss the fruits of her labours, whether
you've read all four books or none - this could be a contemporary
author you want to read more of!

  <th>Discussion: Octavia E. Butler</th>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>11 Ashworth Park, Barton Road</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Octavia Butler is an author who deserves to be better known. Her books are
hard to put down; and, once finished, they are hard to forget. Her themes
explore the boundaries of what it is to be human, both biologically and
psychologically. Her characters are frequently forced to endure moral
dilemmas and savage treatment. For all this, her writing is clear and
expressive - the reader is carried along by the flow, but high-pressure
action is not used to give an artificial sense of tension. The people, and
how they interact, are what matter.<br />
Come along and share this author - or discover her if you haven't already.

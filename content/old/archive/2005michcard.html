Joss Whedon - the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated writer/director
responsible for the worldwide television phenomena of <cite>Buffy the
Vampire Slayer</cite> and <cite>Angel</cite> - now applies his trademark
compassion and wit to a small band of galactic outcasts 500 years in the
future in his feature film directorial debut, <cite>Serenity</cite>.<br />

The film centres around Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a hardened veteran
(on the losing side) of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a
living pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his
ship, Serenity.  He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest
thing he has left to family - squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly
loyal.<br />

When Mal takes on two new passengers - a young doctor and his
unstable, telepathic sister - he gets much more than he bargained for.
The pair are fugitives from the coalition dominating the universe, who
will stop at nothing to reclaim the girl.  The crew that was once used
to skimming the outskirts of the galaxy unnoticed find themselves
caught between the unstoppable military force of the Universal
Alliance and the horrific, cannibalistic fury of the Reavers, savages
who roam the very edge of space.  Hunted by vastly different enemies,
they begin to discover that the greatest danger to them may be on
board Serenity herself.<br />

It is strongly recommended that you book your ticket beforehand; use
the Vue website (<a href="http://www.myvue.com/">http://www.myvue.com/</a>)
or phoneline (08712 240 240). We will meet in the area just inside the
cinema, where the ticket collection posts and food counters are, at 8:40pm
(meeting early to improve our chances of getting good seats).  Look out for an
implausibly long orange scarf.

Arthur C. Clarke is perhaps the UK's best-known and longest-established
SF author. He is probably most familiar for the book and film <cite>2001:
A Space Odyssey</cite>, but, in a career now spanning nearly 70 years, has
published some 20 novels and a vast array of short stories. He is regarded
as the doyen of 'hard' SF, but his work also reveals a considerable interest
in the metaphysical, or even the mystical.<br />

Come along, tell us what you think of this classic author, and hear what
others have to say. Non-members are welcome.

A blockbuster to rock the socks off you, <cite>Night Watch</cite> is an epic
fantasy thriller set in present-day Moscow where the forces of good
and evil prowl in uneasy truce.  The Night Watch patrol the activities
of the darkness, the Day Watch watch over the light.  Anton Gordesky is
introduced to this realm of the supernatural when he tries to get
revenge on his departed wife, finding himself dragged into handling
vampires and his own ESP as the quest begins for the 'Great One' who
will change the balance of power forever.  Racing through Russian
undergrounds, warehouses and gritty apartment blocks this a
super-smart, visually stunning, action-packed marvel where even the
subtitles are having fun - some coloured crimson which fade like blood
in water, some flown back with their speaker into a wall.  Don't miss
it.<br />

To join us, e-mail <b>soc-cusfs at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk.</b>
by midnight on Sunday 16 October (the Arts allocates specific seats when booking,
so we will book for everyone at the same time). Meet in the cafe at the Arts;
look for the long orange scarves.

Explosions galore! Come and help CUSFS <em>ooh!</em> and <em>aah!</em> at
the annual Cambridge firework display on Midsummer Common. We will meet
outside the Fort St. George pub at 7:00 prompt, in time to find a good 
firework-viewing location before the fireworks start at 7:30. Look out for 
long orange scarves! (It's usually VERY busy and latecomers will be 
unlikely to find us. You have been warned.) After the display we will
probably retire to the Carlton Arms on Carlton Way (10-15 minutes' walk)

Once upon a time, <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> had not been printed,
and publishers had never heard of "fantasy". Authors did not have to write
fat trilogies describing quests across the entire map. Instead, they were
free to produce whatever they wanted - any structure, any length - and so,
before it even existed, the fantasy genre was given some of its most
distinctive, enjoyable and enduring works.<br />

Come along and explore these authors and books with us; discover what makes
them, still, some of the freshest and most lively voices in fantasy.

Ken MacLeod is probably Britain's most overtly political SF author. His
"Fall Revolution" series (<cite>The Star Fraction</cite>, <cite>The Stone Canal</cite>,
<cite>The Cassini Division</cite>, <cite>The Sky Road</cite>) explored the politics and
economics of a capitalist / communist / anarchist (in various proportions) future, both
on Earth and in various other places. This was followed by the "Engines of Light" series
(<cite>Cosmonaut Keep</cite>, <cite>Dark Light</cite>, <cite>Engine City</cite>) which
famously introduced the 'squids in space', along with several planetfuls of humans whose
ancestors were kidnapped from Earth, and who provide some further economic laboratories.<br / >

Come along, discuss and find out more about this interesting author,
including (maybe) where, when and why "I hope I will see you again".

A discussion where everyone will have an opinion... Come along and encounter
feuds being born and friendships ended as people reveal their favourite author,
laying their souls open before the weekly CUSFS discussion. Whether you want to
revel in the popularity of the likes of Pratchett or Tolkien or promote a
little known author whom you consider worthy of adoration - then this is the
discussion to do it at! Alternatively it's worth coming along and sitting
quietly at the back, just to hear the advice of others and build up that
reading list into treble figures again...<br />

This year the discussion will be fuelled by mince pies and mulled wine. Come
along and enjoy!

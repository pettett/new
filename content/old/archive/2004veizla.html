<p>The Veizla is the annual dinner of Jómsborg the New, and also marks the
inauguration of a new Reeve and Companions. There will be a mead reception
with puzzles and the annual Jómsphoto, followed by dinner (during which
people will be asked to answer the Reeve's challenge - see below), followed
by port and more mead, and the traditional announcement of the new Reeve and
Companions. Afterwards we will retire to 155 Gilbert Road for further
merriment.</p>

<p>If you intend to take part, and have not yet said so, you <strong>must
e-mail <b>soc-cusfs at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk.</b>, by
6pm on Friday 11th</strong>. Please say whether you want a vegetarian or
omnivorous meal, and whether you want alcohol or not. There is a limit of 35 places.</p>

<p>The mead reception starts at 6:30pm (note the slightly changed time) and
dinner at 7:30. There will be J&oacute;msvikingar in the porters' lodge at
6:30ish. If you're late, we will be found drinking mead in the walkway
and surrounding gardens - follow the main corridor from the porters'
lodge until you reach the outdoor part and we will be somewhere nearby
(look for the orange scarves). If you're <em>really</em> late we will be in
the Council Room for dinner (ask the porters for directions).</p>

<p>The finalised omnivorous menu is as follows (this has changed from the
provisional menu previously published):</p>
<ul>
 <li>duck and orange pate</li>
 <li>chicken supreme, mushrooms and tarragon sauce</li>
 <li>raspberry br&ucirc;l&eacute;e tart</li>
</ul>

<p>The vegetarian menu is as yet unfixed; if you want a vegetarian dinner
then please <strong>e-mail soc-cusfs at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk.</strong> to let us know what your food dislikes are, so that
the New Hall Catering Dept can invent something which avoids them.</p>

<p>The dress code is black tie or fancy dress.</p>

<p>The total cost will be &pound;25 for drinkers, &pound;15 for non-drinkers.
Make cheques payable to CUSFS and send them to Helen Cousins at Newnham College
(CB3 9DF) or bring them along to the dinner itself.</p>

<p>There is also a challenge!</p>

<p>"For the amusement and entertainment of the Reeve and assembled company,
you are requested to prepare a poem on a subject of interest to J&oacute;msborg
(suggested themes being the virtues of mead, how much you would really
love to invade Norway, why we are all going to Valhalla, what makes a
really good book... but whatever you like really). The Reeve would much
prefer that this poem is in a recognised poetic form; here is a
<a href="http://fox.rollins.edu/~phelan/PoeticForm.html">handy list</a>
of such things (and yes it includes free verse and *yes* that would be a
cop-out, so ner.)</p>

<p>"Extra mead for anyone managing to write a sestina or villanelle including
the Jómsborg motto 'Eigi Eru Enn Allir J&oacute;msvikingar Dau&eth;ir' ('Not Yet Are
All the J&oacute;msvikings Dead'). Extra extra mead for anyone who makes the
Reeve laugh."</p>

other cheap punt hire are especially welcome...

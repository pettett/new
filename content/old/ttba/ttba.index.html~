<h1>Title to be Announced: complete index of contents</h1>

<h2>Where to find them</h2>

Entries in this index for 'Archive' indicate where back issues of
<cite>ttba</cite> can be found.  'University Library' refers to a box
kept in the Rare Books Room of the Cambridge University Library under
classmark cam.a.21.9 (which contains a reasonably complete set of
volumes 1 to 8) and to a folder which may be asked for at the
Periodicals Desk (which contains a very incomplete set of volumes 9 to
17).  'Editor's collection' refers to some folders that should be in
the possession of the current editor of <cite>ttba</cite>.  All the
issues in volumes 9 to 17 that aren't in the UL or in the Editor's
collection (except for Volume 13 Number 3) are in the collection of
Jon Fairbairn. There is also a folder in the CUSFS library that
contains a subset of those in the Editor's collection.<p>

Thanks to Andy Conway for corrections to this index.<p>

<Hr><A Name="editoria"><H2>Editorial: Tramping Through the Blackpool
Aftermath</H2></A>

<H3>Robert Wilson and Gareth Rees</H3>

The NUT met last weekend (as I write) in a hotel in Blackpool to admit
the uselessness of ideology in the face of reality; soon the political
parties will be back in Blackpool on their merry&#173;go&#173;round of
dying seaside resorts, their manifestoes and ideologies and
fundamental values no longer important, or even particularly relevant
to the modern world.<p>

And as it is with them, so it is with sf.<p>

I am talking, of course, about Illumination, the 1992 British national
sf convention.  This is the annual meeting of fans and authors, and if
there is some movement shaping among the many talented British sf
authors then we should have heard of it.  But no, there are no
manifestos, no great theorists of the genre, no Movements ready to
spring their deconstructive theories upon an unsuspecting readership.
There are just a bunch of authors producing good and bad work on their
own.<p>

Are there any suitable candidates about?  The five authors who made up
the Cyberpunk Movement of the mid&#173;eighties have all moved on to
different, and in my opinion better things, and those authors who
continue to write cyberpunk novels are mostly imitating the style and
the surface gloss of the genre, ignorant of or unconcerned with the
ideas that went into the original Movement works (see my review of
<cite>Halo</cite> by Tom Maddox in this issue for an example of this
kind of fiction). There are other derivative genres of cyberpunk: the
`steampunk' of K W Jeter's <cite>Infernal Devices</cite> and Gibson
and Sterling's <cite>The Difference Engine</cite> or the
`splatterpunk' that takes the energetic style of cyberpunk and fuses
it with violent horror - but none of these have produced, to my
knowledge, the slightest hint of critical thinking, or have any kind
of agenda for the genre.  The authors are just individuals who have
caught onto a good thing.  Rudy Rucker expounds some kind of
`freestyle' writing philosophy which insofar as I can make out, is
nebulous in the extreme: "Write what you like," he seems to be saying,
"but make it hip!"<p>

What about David Pringle's (in)famous editorial in
<cite>Interzone</cite> in which he derided the inward&#173;looking,
earth&#173;bound sf of the `Wessex School' (Chris Priest, Keith
Roberts, Garry Kilworth, John Christopher and others) and called for a
new, energetic, outward&#173;looking space&#173;oriented sf that would
be exemplified by Stephen Baxter and Paul J McAuley?  Quite a few
people (myself included) wrote to IZ criticising him for this
`manifesto' advocating low&#173;quality happy&#173;clappy space
advocacy (as we saw it).  Perhaps it is the case that we wrote less
out of fear that IZ would go down the plughole of Analog than out of
an enthusiasm that at last we had a manifesto, a movement, something
to react against.  But no, Pringle backed away from his earlier
statements.  We should not look to him for inspiration.<p>

Now here's a worrying development: Bantam/Spectra has a new imprint
called `The Next Wave'.  The authors published under it are young and
competent mid&#173;list authors but there's nothing special about them
nor do they have any pretensions to a literary movement.  The
publishers seem to have discovered that movements sell - no doubt we
can expect that future movements in sf will be no more than marketing
creations.<p>

So where should we look for the future of the genre?  I don't know,
but the most interesting programme item at Illumination featured John
Clute and Geoff Ryman talking (in part) about what Ryman needs to do
in order to remain a Great Author.  Clute's contention was that Great
Authors are of their time or ahead of their time: look at Philip K
Dick - we are still catching up with what his writings mean to us.  To
write works that stand the test of time you really have to be in tune
with the times, and not only with the surface detritus of our culture,
but with its deep concerns.  Ryman tells us that he is currently
researching into Islamic culture, poetry and science; perhaps we
should follow him as he surfs along the crest of the wave of now.<p>



<hr><A Name="chairbei"><H2>Chairbeing's Address</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

The CUSFS committee for 1992-93 were elected at the social
meeting on May 14th, with the exception of the post of membership
secretary.  Re&#173;Open Nominations defeated the other candidates for
this post at the first election, and a second election was held on
June 11th.  The new committee is therefore:

<pre>
Chairbeing              Gareth Rees         Christ's
Secretary               Helen Steele        Newnham
Treasurer               Toby Fagan          Christ's
Membership Secretary    David Jones         Trinity
TTBA Editor             Michael Williams    Sidney Sussex
                        Josie Collins       New Hall
Librarian               David Anderson      Gonville & Caius
</pre>

Feel free to get in touch with us if you feel that there is anything
amiss with the way CUSFS is run, or indeed in the unlikely event that
you wish to congratulate us on our dedication and selfless
endeavour.<p>

Many, many thanks to all of the old committee and especially to
Philippa, for carrying out what I am sure I am about to find is a
really awful job.<p>

<hr><A Name="letterto"><H2>Letter To The Editors</H2></A>

Dear Sir,<p>

While sensible of the many merits of your publication, as an amateur
of science and a citizen of the world I cannot help feeling that what
it lacks is a regular column dedicated to the amusing anomalies and
interesting information which the beacon of science can sometimes
illuminate.  It would not surprise me to learn that many of your
readers feel the same.  May I ask if you intend such a column, and if
so may I congratulate you for your dedication not only to that
expression of human ingenuity which paves the way for the Modern
Future, but also to those highly amusing morsels of trivia which are
the common grazing of every educated mind,<p>

Yours faithfully,<p> Simon Curtis Cinnamon Pick<p>

<strong>The Editors Reply:</strong> by one of those strange
coincidences, or should we say synchronicities, which are apt to
astound and amaze the orthodox scientific community, we have in this
very issue a column as like to the one which you describe in your
letter as if you had written it yourself.<p>



<hr><A Name="insiders"><H2>Illumination: Insider's Report</H2></A>

<H3>Amanda Baker</H3>

If you don't know what Illumination was, then shame on you! It was the
1992 British National Science Fiction convention, held in Blackpool
this Easter, and you missed a great convention.  But don't ask me - I
was only there in body, not in mind!<p>

Yes, I, Amanda Baker, by virtue of my well&#173;known and close
association with Famous Oxford Astro&#173;Physicist Dr Dave `Cosmic'
Clements, had the great pleasure over two years ago of suddenly
finding myself on an Eastercon committee!  I didn't volunteer, I
didn't have any experience (beyond DCM&#173;ing at one Picocon), I
didn't want to do it, I had never attended an Eastercon... and I was
suddenly one of the Ten Invisible Masters.<p>

For me, Illumination was one long mad dash (interspersed with the odd
seven hours of sleep now and then).  Committee round&#173;up at 9am,
then on with the wally&#173;phone and off to Green Room to be
Programme Oops.  Your item needs an OHP five minutes ago?  You're on a
panel and all the other people haven't made it to the convention?
Your inflatable banana has a puncture?  No problem!  I'll just radio
operations, who will put me through to the technical crew, and we'll
have a gopher over in no time!<p>

One of the high points was on Saturday (I think - all the days ran
together!)  when the Russians, Juri and Andrei, arrived from Moscow.
They had travelled by train to Prague, hitched to the ferry, missed
their contact in London and so took a National Express bus to
Blackpool.  The journey took them four <em>days</em>, and on their
backs they carried enough books, badges and other souvenirs to sell to
pay for their journey home.  They arrived just in time for the SF Club
Deutchland (Regional Group Great Britain) party, and after a full day
of headless&#173;chickening, I ended up serving them Norbreck Hotel
Special Alcoholic Punch half an hour after it had `run out'!<p>

To all those who are thinking of organising a convention, I'd like to
say just one thing.  Running a con is the only way to get the
convention <em>you</em> would like to attend - but you still don't get
to attend it!<p>



<hr><A Name="conventi"><H2>Illumination: Convention Report</H2></A>

<H3>Helen Steele</H3>

Illumination was the British National SF Convention for 1992, held at
the Norbreck Castle Hotel, Blackpool on April 17-20.<p>

Illumination was my third Eastercon and undoubtably the best.  Well
programmed, smoothly running - the Illumination committee can feel
proud of their convention.  What is more, Illumination was fun, and
once it got going there seemed to be little time for sitting around
doing nothing.<p>

Illumination had three guests of honour - Geoff Ryman, Paul MacAuley
and Pam Wells - and they were all well chosen.  But by far the best
(and most active) was Geoff Ryman who popped up all over the
programme, the highlight being his third <cite>Wizard of Oz</cite>
talk (the previous two being given at WinCon I and Confiction, the
1990 WorldCon).  Geoff was also `interviewed' by the
<cite>Interzone</cite> critic John Clute, gave a reading from his new
books <cite>Was</cite> and took part in the moving tribute to the
recently deceased Angela Carter.  The other success of the programme
seemed to be the popularity of the science stream.  Talks by Colin
Jack, Jack Cohen and others were well attended and, in marked contrast
to some other conventions, funny as well as informative.  Other
personal favourites were the Urban myth workshop with Robert Holdstock
and the panel on Building religions - where Alison Scott divulged some
facts about pineapple rings and whipped cream and decided that sf
fandom really is a religion.<p>

A programme however good, cannot work if the organisation is a
shambles.  Fortunately at Illumination this was not the case.  Bar the
occasional hiccup and some minor quibbles, either the con did run
smoothly or the committee were very good at hiding it.  In fact the
main worry seemed to be whether the wally&#173;phones
(walkie&#173;talkies) were water&#173;proof - it rained solidly on the
Saturday as Hugh Mascetti and Armageddon were setting up the fireworks
display.  Fortunately the rain stopped and the display went ahead and
proved magnificent.<p>

The final point must be the hotel.  The staff at the Norbreck castle
were great and they seemed to enjoy the experience (indeed the manager
wanted to know how <em>he</em> could bid for next year's Eastercon),
which always helps both the convention members and the committee.  The
programme rooms were a bit spread out, but this just meant there was
plenty of space to lounge around (though it was a little tiring for
the gophers and other staff).  The Norbreck Castle itself is not as
plush as some other hotels and the rooms are not as big as the hotel
last year (vitally important when you are intending to crash on a
floor!)  but all in all I think it was a good choice - despite
previous worries.  Blackpool was as tacky as ever but we managed to
avoid it except for one curry&#173;run on the Saturday night.<p>

Illumination was a good example of how a con should be run.  Of course
there were problems but only minor ones, easily sorted out, which did
not detract from the enjoyment most people seemed to get from
attending.<p>



<hr><A Name="daysends"><H2>Day's End</H2></A>

<H3>Simon Pick</H3>

<blockquote> I may not have thews of banded iron,<br>

I may not have a dauntless heart,<br>

I may not face danger with merry quips<br>

And triumph through my swordsman's art;<br>

Few are the princesses I have rescued,<br>

Few are the villains I have crushed<br>

Yet I still stand proud with the best of men<br><br>

- But in the end I'm not worth very much.  </blockquote>



<hr><A Name="thirstfo"><H2>The Thirst For Blood (De Excidio
Mundi)</H2></A>

<H3>Simon Pick</H3>

In the dark ways, down the deep ways, stalk the vampire brood.  They
thirst for human blood, they ache for human flesh to fill their many
uses.  What does a vampire require?  There is his food, and his lust,
and his love, and his secret hate like a worm within him - his dark
steel Satanic cruelty from the new organ which pulses deep within his
unliving chest, which replaces the dessicated puffsack of his defunct
heart.  Why are the unliving ones hateful to man?  Because of the
secrets they know in their minds which man cannot, because of the
knowledge which man is not permitted, because man is thus no longer
the pinnacle and summit of the Creation.  And because it is on man
that they feed.  What difference is there in the mind of a vampire and
the mind of a man?  A vampire knows his own desires.<p>

A vampire's desires are unspeakable to men.<p>

Heed my warning, peoples of the past, warring nations of Earth!  I
write a message from the ruined world of the future, where we scholars
hide in the great cities of men and the vampires hide in the great
cities of vampires, and neither have much left of the past.  Our world
is torn from yours, and the life in it was spilt in the tearing.
Forgive my rough style if it seems unwieldy to your ears!  It is the
style of the scholarship of the future, it is a style that reflects
our world.  If I seem to you extreme in laying bare your future, bear
in mind the extremity of our own.  There is little of your time left.
For this message is returned to you with vampire science and vampire
magic; it is written in the blood of female miscarriages on the skin
of slain vampires, it is cast back through the aeons by its
concealment in the corpse of a vampire as he crumbles to dust.  The
ravage of time seizes the twice dead man with wrath, for the vampire
has broken time's covenant, and time's force pounds at his body until
it is dust, maintained in the present but projected into the past.
The message, so prepared, is carried along in the mystic fury of time
as it claims its own once more.  That a message can be sent has been
proved by our reception of such; but of a message's effect, our
scholars are in doubt.  Can time's anomaly be used to change itself?
Will time permit its own self&#173;mutilation?  The world, rubbed raw
by destruction, cries out that we at least attempt such.  That is why
you have this message, this is why I unveil to you your future, act on
it if you can.<p>

Vampires cannot spawn, but they can breed - literally like flies off
the corpses of men.  In the dark places they hid; when all the world
blossomed, their black blooms sprang too from filth.  They stalked the
night, they increased, they multiplied in unholy fashion, they were
ready.  At once they revealed themselves to the clear sight of men,
smutting his pure vision with proof of their seed.  Not a seed of the
flesh but a seed of the vision, it was, a metaphysic inimical to
humanity but which required humanity for its increase.  Was it
attractive?  Was there ignorance?  Was there incredulity?  Was there
death?  This more than anything.  The revelation of the vampires
brought recruits, power, strength til then nurtured in silent murder
but now freshly rotting in the vitality of the light, a monstrous
efflorescence in the heart of society.  It grew, it festered, it
struck - and then there was war.<p>

We still have in existence thirty seconds worth of videotape of the
vampire delegate to the United Nations Council of Wisdom, but it is
thirty seconds worth of silence for vampires are neither seen nor
heard on videotape.  His description was taken down by reporters, his
speech preserved in a transcript of ancient lore, so we know what he
said.  He said:<p>

"We are the vampires of Earth!  We have sloughed ourselves from the
warm rot of men and represent the chosen path to the future.  This is
our ultimatum, to which you must concede because we are your future in
our living death, we flaunt against eternity's decay and so will
outlast you.  We will drain off you, and you - willing or unwilling -
will give out the flow.  We want a continent - Africa - and the people
of Africa whom we may breed for our perpetuance, and the carrion and
beasts of Africa that we may feed our men even as they act as beasts
for us; and we want the resources and wealth of an earth&#173;borne
continent that we may build us our cities and our metal coffins and
our padded coffins and our palaces and vaults of dark, wherein we
engage and are happy.  We want one hundred years of isolation, to
build the new world in which the new vampires can live.  We will
transform the continent!  We will tap its human wealth and its
material wealth.  We will build mighty stone cities of silent coffin
sleepers, great monorails and tarmacked trading routes down which our
vampire convoys will carry our stock.  We will draw from ourselves our
art, our music, our utopian darkness and perpetual massive works of
creation - the art of the dead.  We will build the model for the
world.<p>

Those are our demands, as a sovereign nation and a racial group
demanding its liberty.  By your own standards of right you cannot deny
us, nor by the standards of fate.  If you do not accede to our
demands, we will go to war, and we are more numerous and stronger than
you can know.<p>

We await your decision."<p>

And the vampire ambassador left the United Nations with his clerical
aides rather than face the massed anger of the world's nations.  A
story says they slaughtered a young boy in the carpark for their
lunch.<p>

And on the refusal of the burning broad demands of this public secret
man - the upstanding light&#173;shy hatch of the silent seethe of
their innumerability in the suspension of that society - on the
refusal, I say, hell broke loose.  The vampires came out!  The
vampires were abroad!  How could we fight?  How could we turn with
dripping stake and see the man at our backs, our wives, our friends to
whom we'd revealed our inner light hiss and bare us their sudden
teeth?  Lovers, leaders, the high and low, all had drenched at the
taint.  They danced in our sunbaked cities, swarming like bats in a
seacave until they blocked the sun.  We regrouped, we reformed, we
struck out again and again with our rugged wooden tusks in awful
slaughter until the streets ran red with blood and white with ichor,
or merely choked in drifts of dust from the mummy dessication of the
death&#173;spoor of time's allergy.  Men drowned dry in
house&#173;high drifts of vampire&#173;death.  But worst of all were
the unknown infiltration tunnellings into society's unsurveyable core
- vampire tunnels as one bit another bit another on down and through
like black threads through a crumpled tapestry: we were clawed from
within.  Regroup!  Retrench!  Fall back on those you trust!  If your
left hand offends you - as a few remnant fragments have it - cut it
off; if you mother's teeth offend you, cut her through! And they fled
our righteous wrath, and clung together like flies swarming on dung,
and they worked their cities from tiny huts and clusters into great
horrifying atomic powerhouses (for the dirty death explosion at the
atom's heart is the dirty death energy fallout that's the buzz from
the vampire core, and the worm which trawls the sun's innards
devouring burnt hydrogen is the decay void finality that the vampires
bask in in hideous reverse), metal crag cities of ancient screams and
perpetual cozening night&#173;stalkers, who at midnight gang the
walkways and throng the squares round the red&#173;painted mahogany
flesh&#173;cages to prod and poke and tease and feast on their cattle
and their capture, and by their feeding - in the only release they can
know for their longing for perpetuity - breed exponential their new
vampires anew.  Glaciers of enamelled steel! the vampire strongholds.
And we men cower in our mirrored halls, in the shifting plates of our
mirrored armour, and we feel the rim of our bakelite neckguards like
the collars of history's slaves; and we men administrate our petty
empires and commune with the states we trust and fear for the
men&#173;states we don't, and we live on vampire technology and work
our miracles by vampire science, and contest our scattered remnants
against their dark satanic chill.  And we always look over our
shoulders, lest our mirrors lie - for look, the mirror being the
machine of light and operating on the reflection of light has no gear
in its mechanism for the appreciation of vampires, which are the very
soul and spirit of lightless dark, and so are our insurance and our
eyes for us.  But if our head's eyes see nothing, then neither can our
extended toolish ones, and the vampire behind you can never be
revealed by the mirrored walls in front until his clawed hands rip the
bakelite toothblunter from your neck.  Our prince in his mirror
armour, Pope&#173;blessed, in the open perspex cathedral stood over
the incense burners in the play of the garlic fumes and raised his
hands, heavy with cross&#173;rings, to give us his welcome, and I was
there, and he said as the jets thundered in the sun overhead: "Even in
the open and the light, we are stalked, and the blinding of the lights
of our defence may cloak the enemy," and it is true.<p>

For where are our weapons?  Where are our bullets and guns against the
amorphous dead?  Lo, where is the mighty unutterable Bomb that can
split this earth like an overboiled egg fired against the wall?  It
encases the mindless destroying split seed, the subtle insinuating
radiation death that the vampires soak and enjoy and multiply in, and
is useless.  Where are the valour of the strong and the sweat of the
brave?  Vampires, effortless, are smooth and do not sweat, but with
the noses of feral hunters can smell the sweat of the honest living
man for a mile.  Where are knives gone, where are axes gone, where are
guns gone in this resurrectable life?  Lo, we developed weapons anew
to meet the threat.  We have swords of silver and crossbows of wood,
and wooden stakes and wooden bolts.  We have our terrifying splinter
guns, and our bolt ships and our mighty splinter jets which thunder
through the sun and rain stakes down upon the land.  We have our fine
sprays of garlic mist and our squirts of Aqua Sancta.  The surface of
America is a face of running moats! a checkerboard of streams more
substantial as blockades than walls and mirror posts and mirror
ramparts and the rolling garlic plantations where collared serfs in
rustling gowns of a thousand tiny mirrors toil in the shadows of the
scarecrow crucifixes.  We wear our plate mirror and our
ring&#173;mirror and our scale mirror into battle, our head proud
bullets in mirror helms pointing unerring forwards at the dark horde
as we charge with fearing heart but silver nerve to dusty battle with
death, wielding our stakes and struts like wooden teeth hungry for the
taste of dry vampire gut and sticky ichor.  The silver
fire&#173;engines of war pump a million gallons of holy water with the
force of blood through the tunnels of a living heart, surging away the
armies of the undead!  There is struggle never&#173;ceasing.  I have
seen the tanks!  I have been to
New&#173;Rome&#173;on&#173;the&#173;Mississippi, and seen the mighty
mass&#173;blessed reservoirs where the Ever&#173;Holy Pope - by the
miracle of the divine Force working through his body in a world made
porous to wonder by the debalancing of time's laws - does work his
hands forever giving blessing over blessing in eight&#173;hour killing
shifts to make the water holy which burns the Enemy.  I have seen the
immersion tanks where His Holiness is dipped one after the other to
turn the water to living fire where it may wash the vampire skin,
raddling their substance's outer shield like irrigation canals
ploughed through the surface of a desert.  The legions of the mighty
are small but hard.  But to what avail?  What use are our warbands,
our effort, our strife?  The solid shadows of the night have their own
war and weapons, their Marshals and Generals and mighty exertions, and
their Engines and Constructions of war which mash and twist and seize
us in our hundreds for their grotesquerie of lust and food.  We are
the hunted.<p>

We are the used.<p>

We are the food.<p>

Our numbers are a mere fractional proportion of those of our
ancestors; we live in fear and constant vigilance and unceasing cares
that leave us never carefree.  Our minds strain perpetually under the
possibility of curse that leaves us aged and grey; there may next
minute of our lives be death or the unspeakable.  We live in horror
for the consumption of our metaphysic, our last internal stronghold,
our tiny soul.  Vampires and we, we grip the earth.  They stalk, we
hide, they mass, we fight; the last Bright Empire is behind its own
transparent locks and bars, and theirs is fortified too in its
wickedness.  And in the toll of war and conversion we both of us
dwindle towards zero.  And this is not the worst.  This is not the
worst.<p>

For consider, if it is the extraction of blood by vampire means that
makes a living man a vampire, then it is the restoration of that human
essential by human means that can make a vampire a man.  And so our
feeble bodies groan under the necessary tax, we cripple our wasted
substances to feed all we can of ourselves to the great transfusion
banks and not one of us, not the Pope in his Vatican, not the prince
in his hospital, not the most anaemic slave in his glass hovel in the
dirt is free from the tax of blood.  And we take our captured vampires
and strap them, screaming incomprehension, to a one of the massed
ranks of transfusion tables and by the application of a device of
needle and a surgical straw, a surgeon, having filled his mouth with
blood so that it drips from his living lips, blows it back into human
veins.  The nasty ichor, displaced, oozes hated to the floor from an
incision in the feet.  And vampire becomes man.  And if such a
foot&#173;marked man is seized again, and drained once more at Vampire
banquets for the joyless birth of a new vampire hero, he does become
once more like them in form and matter and negation of spirit; and if
again captured by us, may so be reverted again and it is not
impossible for such to be three or four times shuttlecocked between
estates, or nine or ten.  And those who have had such are unable to
explain what they were as a vampire, nor are they pressed hard upon
the subject for it seems to them to have passed as in a dream.  And
adrift in the memory are their past manners, if not of the kind of the
functioning particle they now embody. But this is not the worst.  For
the rumours have the deepest horror, and fly without ceasing, for they
say that if pushed too much from life to void and back, from the
breathing burn of the living to the static negation of the
counterbrood, THE MATTER OF OUR FORMS IS NOT STABLE and can slip, and
fall into the vampire terror like an elastic band that, stretched,
snaps between extremes - but a band that moves with the steady majesty
of decay.  And, too, if men once restored from vampires can revert,
may not the proselytised vampires of the ebony cities find that among
their number they have warm, living, cringing men where before but
yesterday there was one of their own?  And this is the pollution of it
all, that all men are so bound up together against the threat that
roars savaging out of the void, out of nothing at all, that they act
as one and think and exist as one against the horror of time's
opposite, and the vampires hunt also as a mighty pack - dwindling at
the rate we dwindle in numbers, but this is to their advantage as they
are creatures borne of the maelstrom of Nothing, the whirlpool of No
Elements that takes place in the vastness of Nowhere, and so to
dwindle to extinction is to take this dying planet to their natural
home and not ours - and so are bound against us in common unity.  And
this being so, our race minds are each unified, ours to our common aim
and they to theirs, and in this commonality and oneness open to
affection across the multitude from the tendency of the one, as one
bad apple in a basket will set them all spoiling.  Our minds are one.
We tremble in fear - and the fear does stimulate the danger, that is
sure - as we wonder if it is not possible that, if the legion of the
footmarked&#173;reclaimed risk reversion, so might not a healthy
human, an innocent, an untouched newborn baby?  And so turn vampire
with no provocation but merely the loss of anchorage of its own
intrinsic substance? And may not any fresh vampire turn Man?  THIS IS
THE WORST.  And does the clock tick all the way each time?  Does
nothing ever run down, does no process ever lose itself and become
half&#173;cut?  Are we not afraid of the existence of partial
transformation, the half&#173;vampire, the common denominator which
all purity, life and death, would abhor, trapped in limbo and content
with nothing because there is nothing created to suit its adulterated
spirit?  Is this what is to be?  Is this what we spiral down to?  And
hand to hand, breast to breast, mouth to mouth, clawing while crushed
in mutual dependence, in shift one to the other, vampire to man, man
to vampire, like the slow pulsings of the planetary heart, we two
races - life and its opposite - on a dying world evolve endlessly
together into the infinity of the future.<p>



<hr><A Name="movingup"><H2>Moving Up</H2></A>

<H3>Matthew Freestone</H3>

(excerpted from `Lifestyle' magazine March '71.)<p>

M.H. -- Ms. Maupin, you and your husband became highly successful
after founding Overland Interface, but how did you make the decision
to move up in the first place?<p>

J.M. -- Well Michael, I realise people move up now at the drop of a
hat, but back then - this is back in '67 - people still saw Overland
as a sort of retirement home.  So it took something fairly major to
make us move - I mean, we would still be down here now if it hadn't
been for Hilary's accident.<p>

M.H. -- Do you want to talk about that?<p>

J.M. -- Well it started in August '66 - back then we lived in
Barrington, that's a suburb just outside of Chicago.  I was living
with Ambrose and Hilary, that's our daughter, had just turned five.
We were quite well off - I worked in Global law and Ambrose had a job
share in technical writing.  Anyway we'd had my parents down for the
day - they'd died a couple of years ago - and they'd been doting on
Hilary.  They'd bought her one of those fairies that were so popular
then - they were sort of autonomous Net&#173;ghosts and they could
carry messages and that sort of thing, but I'm getting off the point
here.  Well, after my parents had gone home I took Hilary upstairs to
put her to bed.  I got her tucked in and she said to me something
like, "Mom, do you have grandparents?"  I told her I had and of
course, being a little mercenary, she wanted to know when they would
be coming to visit.  Well, it didn't seem a good idea to tell her
right then, but the next day I had a little chat with her to explain
that back in the past, people weren't stored, so they disappeared when
they died.  That confused her some, so then I had to explain a bit
about the Net and about Overland.<p>

M.H. -- People say it comes naturally to kids, do you agree?<p>

J.M. -- Well, yes in a way Mr. Higa, but they don't see it the way we
do.  I mean they can't remember knowing anyone who isn't stored. That
was the problem.  She developed a fantasy fulfilment disorder.<p>

M.H. -- We don't have to go into depth, if you'd rather not.<p>

J.M. -- No, it's okay. I mean, some of this stuff still hurts me, but
I've come to terms with what happened - the guilt we felt - and if it
helps other people to know what happened to us then at least that's
something positive out of it.  So anyway, after our talk, what she
really picked up on was that Overland was a place you could go.  I
don't think she'd really understood before that Grandma and Grandpa
had to go somewhere when they disappeared, and of course she wanted to
go there herself.  Well, back then FFD was just speculation in
psychology journals rather than material for "Better Parenting" so we
thought that if we just wired her in we could send her to my parents
and they could take her out for a day.  My parents didn't know any
better either, so they did all the fun things - they let her fly, they
let her play immersion games and they brought her down here as a Net
ghost so she could see herself.<p>

After that she went on to get the classic early symptoms - to start
with it was just her bothering us to let her go back, so we fixed up
for her to go and visit her grandparents every other Saturday and that
accelerated the process.  After a couple of weeks she was off her food
and she was complaining all the time that she felt heavy and stupid
when she was down here, that she wanted to be up in Overland all the
time.  I guess one time when I got angry with her I must have said
that only dead people live in Overland.  I definitely remember her
having a tantrum where she just lay on the floor with her eyes
squeezed shut, beating the ground with her fists and shouting, "I want
to be dead!"  again and again.<p>

So we took her to the doctor, but there wasn't really that much she
could do - to be fair she had heard of FFD cases and she explained to
us how Overland was very much like a projection of the young child's
fantasy realm - but it was new and she didn't know any therapists for
it. So she fixed us up with a senior child&#173;psychologist - Koorts
in fact.<p>

M.H. -- This is Richard Koorts, right?<p>

J.M. -- Well sure, it was Hilary's case that set off his research into
FFD really.  Anyway, he recommended activities that weren't available
in Overland, so we took Hilary to a playgroup to get her more peer
group contact.  That had some remedial effect - she liked going to the
playgroup, but she didn't see why she couldn't live in Overland and go
to playgroup too.  So, time passed and we didn't seem to be going
anywhere - Hilary was unhappy a lot of the time, and she sometimes
refused to react or move at all when she was down here.  We were under
a great deal of strain and I think that's largely why we tried giving
her the `cold turkey' treatment.  We forbade her to go on her usual
visit.  Well, she threw a fit, then she ran upstairs and hid in her
room in a sulk. Ambrose and I had had enough, and we left her to
it.<p>

So we'd just settled down to watch the midday news when we heard her
scream growing louder and louder and then cut off with a terrible sort
of `thwack' as she hit the bottom stair.  We rushed over to her, but
she was quite obviously dead - her neck was twisted and - well, then
of course the Net ran her last Overland template and she appeared next
to us at the bottom of the stairs.  Of course all she could remember
was going to bed the previous evening and so she looked round confused
and said, "What's happening?"  Ambrose just stood there totally
dumbstruck and I really blew up.  I tried to smack her - can you
believe that? - but of course it was her Net ghost so I went right
through.  Ambrose sort of slumped into a chair and started to cry and
I started shouting at her - stuff like, "Well now you've got what you
wanted you little shit! Now you've killed yourself!" But she just
stood there and said, "Don't shout at me Mommy, I can fly!" before
zooming off round the room.  I sat down next to Ambrose and started to
laugh and cry at the same time.<p>

M.H. -- What happened after that?<p>

J.M. -- Well we had a funeral of course - and we took Hilary along
since we thought it would do her good to say goodbye to that part of
herself.  After that she lived with my parents for a while and we
visited back and forth, but it was all rather strained.  My parents
made it clear that they weren't going to look after her forever and
Ambrose's parents had been good Catholics back when it was still a sin
to be stored - they didn't even have nano injections, so they could
only see Net ghosts if they wore eyephones.  Anyway, Hilary needed us,
so we made wills to ourselves then just booked ourselves into a clinic
to get euthanased.  We had a big wake for our friends, then we sold
the real house and kept a template to live in.<p>

M.H. -- So then you founded Overland Interface in '69?<p>

J.M. -- Yes, we set it up as a consultancy to advise business on a
more constructive use of Overland.  After all, there were several
million people up here just being stored under the `Right to Life' act
of '62 - people just hadn't woken up to the human resources
available.<p>

M.H. -- Any regrets about moving up?<p>

J.M. -- I suppose I miss not being able to touch real things.  I still
find Overland stuff all feels the same&#173;-though the routines are
being upgraded all the time - and if what I read in Scientific
American is true we should have commercial decanting in a few years,
so I'll be able to move down for a time and refresh my memory.  Now,
if you'll excuse me, I have an avatar in New York who I should
collect.  Goodbye Mr. Higa.<p>

M.H. -- Thank you for your time Ms. Maupin.<p>



<hr><A Name="acarjour"><H2>A Car Journey</H2></A>

<H3>David Anderson</H3>

In the front, Sam's parents were having another argument.  His mother
had just threatened to get out and walk, again, despite them being
somewhere in the middle of the longest motorway in the country with
the summer evening drawing in.  Sam wanted to get out as well.  The
car was claustrophobic, and he had a mild attack of carsickness.  He
could get out; the door wasn't child&#173;locked.  Of course they were
doing eighty down the central lane.  Abruptly he felt a terrifying
urge to do it, to open the door and leap out.  He would just have to
unlock the door, pull on the handle and jump.  Perhaps he wouldn't
even need to jump; he'd just be sucked out.  He fought down the urge;
there was no way he was going to do anything of the sort.<p>

But the feeling wouldn't go away.  He could just reach out to the door
lock, by the window...  He wouldn't.  The urge was very strong, but he
wouldn't do it.  He was not going to do it.  He could imagine what
would happen.  The door would fly open; he'd fall out into the
traffic.  He could imagine his family looking round, aghast, at his
tumbling body disappearing under a car behind.  They would be shocked,
wondering how he could have done it.  It wouldn't happen.  It would be
very easy though; he'd just have to reach out...  He sat on his hand
to stop himself from doing it.<p>

It wouldn't work.  He could easily take his hand out from under him.
A sign went past.  He looked at it.  Another one hundred and twenty
miles.  One and a half hours to resist the urge.  He began to panic.
He wasn't going to be able to stop himself.  He looked round at his
family.  There was a grim silence in the car; the family all thinking
about the argument that had just taken place.  This was how divorces
started.  If he jumped out, would they blame each other?  How was he
going to stop himself.  What would he say?  "Help, I'm feeling
suicidal"?  They'd probably just look blank and then what would they
do?  Panic?  Hold on to him during the whole journey?  It wouldn't do
any good to tell them; it would worry them silly.<p>

Perhaps it wouldn't happen.  But it could.  He would reach out like
this...  He didn't reach out; if he did he would surely go the whole
way.  The only thing to do was not to even start.  But there were one
and a half hours to go.  Perhaps he should just get it over with.
What on earth could he do?  It wasn't as if he wanted to die.  There
was just this urge in his subconscious that wanted him to kill
himself.<p>

It was getting darker outside the window; almost all of the cars had
their lights on.  He could imagine jumping out into the car coming up
behind.  All he had to do was unlock the door and open it.  It was
just a morbid fantasy, he told himself.  If he put his hand on the
lock like this, he wouldn't necessarily open it.  He could feel it
under his hand; he pulled it up.  There was a click.  None of his
family noticed.  He moved his hand over to the doorhandle.<p>



<hr><A Name="easynowc"><H2>Easy, Now</H2></A>

<H3>Clive Jones</H3>

A meagre suggestion of a trickle of sweat slid between his
shoulder&#173;blades. His subconscious peered from behind its
protective wall, attentive for one tiny instant.  It saw the yellow
blink of a tiny status light - it heard the slightest of clicks in
unknown remote devices.  Had his conscious mind taken part, it would
have appreciated the beauty and simplicity of the click as it lay
gently in the air, before being wafted away by the newly&#173;invoked
burst of air conditioning.  But his conscious mind neither saw nor
heard, and barely noticed even sweating - it had it easy, now.<p>

He glided with distressing ease through the air.  Some years ago, he
had seen an explanation of the mechanisms behind human levitation.
The maths and physics had seemed reasonable enough at the time,
although he had forgotten it mere moments later.  He had no reason to
care how it worked; he only needed to know he could comprehend the
proofs, and his computer could always look up the details again for
him if he wanted.  Yet, for all the science, he could find no
emotional counterpart.  He <em>liked</em> walking, yet levitation was
`better'.  He was no active foe of conformism, but any dissident knows
that one can remain a passive taunt to conventionality only for so
long, in only so many ways, before one has one's knuckles rapped.
Acceptability is a precious commodity to you once you've felt social
rejection, even once.  He had felt it many times, and knew that he
should hover gracelessly by way of transport, rather than use the legs
he was given.  It was not difficult to levitate, it was almost
cowardly - he had it easy, now.<p>

Where next?  Anywhere he cared, so far as he knew.  Spoilt for choice,
he unthinkingly decelerated, the almost undetectable and instinctive
guidance system making the transition from drifting to bobbing as he
neared the crossroads - registering his uncertainty as tiny
reorientations to reflect his many thoughts as to where he should go
next.  He detested this highly visible echoing of his inner
indecisions, and instead dropped into a seat on the thin refuge that
delimited the vehicular portion of the road from the `pedestrian'.
The limited telepathy of the tiny sensor box in his back pocket could
invade his mind, but, as he always comforted himself, only on its own
terms.  While it knew where he wanted to go, it would not register his
wish to go there unassisted.  They said that machines could think now,
which he doubted - certainly none of the ones he had encountered ever
understood his mistrust of them, though the same went for most of his
friends.  In the generations&#173;old search for computers that could
behave like humans, there was some confusion over which of man and
machine had been changed more fundamentally in order to fit the
equation.  But before they released prototype devices, they had been
prudent enough to simulate the possible sociological effects on a
computer, to check that it would work.  After a few shallow critiques
in the media, the fuss calmed down, and the vast majority of the
population came to accept this technology - they had it easy, now.<p>

He had done his day's work, and was, as ever, weary of much that
happened in his town.  The teletransmitter caught his sudden
decisiveness, and he rose from the seat and headed North, effortlessly
ascending the tallest hill of the sparse metropolis.  People rarely
went up the hill - there was nothing at the summit, after all.  As a
place to reflect upon the fate of his city, however, it served him
well.  The domed top afforded a coldly realistic view of the softly
artificial environment. This was life that had been carefully sampled,
processed, and rendered back to replace the original,
characteristically, yet almost imperceptibly, dulling it in the
process.  If a town is becoming congested, then the solution is
obvious: simply make a new one using fractal architecture that was
parameterised from the original, then modified to more closely match
the requirements of the residents.  And, unbelievably, people liked
it, oblivious to the losses they had faced.  Nobody minded the
uniformity of the brickwork, nor the overshadowing of humanity by raw
logic in the mock Edwardian district, nor indeed the telling
implausibilities that marred the pseudo&#173;history of the new town,
and revealed to those who took a second look that for reasons they
couldn't put their fingers on, it just couldn't have happened like
that.  It made him almost frantic to realise that as time went by, he
would become one of a dying breed, since the past itself was being
depicted in their terms.  No longer was it possible to obtain an old
film, unless it had been colour&#173;tinted, smoothed, deglitched,
restabilised and then converted to a raster image, and compacted for
easy transit, based around oh&#173;so&#173;natural assumptions on
where the viewer's eye would wander.  Yes, archive newsreels were
available - he could watch whatever he wanted at a moment's notice,
but that required inquisitiveness.  Inquiry was obsolete; computers
knew what you wanted to find out, and vast processors were dedicated
to the task of keeping citizens well&#173;informed - it was easy,
now.<p>

His equipment belt suddenly began to emit an alarmed bleep as he undid
the buckle and let the belt slide to its ankles. He stepped out and
back, looking at it as it lay there in the grass - an impeccably
planted stretch of turf that constituted one of the city's few
concessions to nature. There was a distinct whistle as more and more
circuits cut in, vainly trying to cope with this unexpected loss of
contact.  The pitch of the bleeping noise rose, and several lights
began to flash.<p>

There was, for once, someone else on the hill, a young programmer.  He
could tell that he was a programmer because of the number of interface
sockets on his belt, and the ridiculously high quality metallic blue
finish that was only an option on the most expensive models of
equipment belt.  He could tell the man was young, because...<p>

Because?<p>

The man <em>was</em> young.  He didn't care how he knew.  He stood
there, knowing, in flagrant defiance of the proofs that intuition was
merely an illusion, that the man was young.<p>

The young man flipped up the visor on his helmet, and glanced
disapprovingly at the discarded belt.<p>

"So you like these, these... then?" the old man asked, waving
indicatively at his belt.<p>

"What are you talking to me for?"  The young man was clearly startled,
and unprepared for vocal communication.  His voice had even developed
a raw and husky quality through lack of use.  Now, when he spoke, it
was only in a whisper, and the fact that he disapproved of the breach
of the peace that his companion had caused with his more forthright
and louder tone of voice was obvious.  "Can't you use your
teletransmitter like everyone else?"<p>

"Can't you talk, like everyone used to?"<p>

The young man ignored him, and instead slid his sleeve up, swiftly
produced a small clinical injection unit, and quietly jabbed the
needle into his arm. With his other hand, he keyed a brief code into
the unit, and a small bolt of liquid slid down the tube into his
arm.<p>

"Great gadget.  Of course, it's not supposed to dispense sedatives
like these, but I did design the damn machines, so I ought to know how
to fiddle them a bit, and after all, I really need something to
calm... ahhhhh... calm my nerves down."  The dose had clearly had its
effect.<p>

"Why do you need to calm your nerves?"<p>

"Yes, I do like teletransmitters.  I helped on the project team that
designed the prototypes.  We were extraordinarily careful to make sure
that they would be compatible with every conceivable human mentality,
and would provide an effortless means of communication between humans
and computers.  Then you just stand there and take yours off.  Hell,
you're weird.  Shit."  The young man paused, realising this didn't
actually answer the most recent question that had been put to him.
"What did you say?"<p>

"Why do you need to calm your nerves?"<p>

"My wife left me this afternoon."<p>

"Oh. I'm sorry."  The older man was clearly at a loss for anything
useful to say at this stage.<p>

"Yeah, so am I, dumbo.  Shit."<p>

So much for sympathy.  Time to try sarcasm instead: "Never mind, I'm
sure you can order another one with your teletransmitter."<p>

"Look, smartass.  Sure, I can order another with my teletransmitter,
but it still costs money, y'know.  Besides, this is the third one I've
lost this week."<p>

So much for sarcasm.  Time to try abject confusion: "Costs money?"<p>

"Yes.  These were robotic wives.  Larger initial outlay, but much
lower running costs, and guaranteed marital harmony.  The snag is that
they're not working yet, and my boss is getting annoyed at the number
of robots we're losing.  It all worked fine under software simulation
a couple of weeks back.  Shit."<p>

So much for confusion.  Time to try despair.  He turned away, as the
young man tapped more keys, and sent three more doses into his blood
stream.  The young man had it easy, now.<p>



<Hr><A Name="wasgeoff"><H2>'Was...' (Geoff Ryman)</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

What does the title mean?  A conflation, perhaps of Wizard and Oz (`If
ever, if ever a wiz there was')?  In 1956, Dorothy lies dying in a
mental hospital in Kansas.  "Uncle Henry, and Aunty Em, they lived in
a cottonwood house that let all the wind in.  It was better to live
underground," she told nurse Bill.  "And where was this?" he asked.
"In Was," she said, "It's a place too.  You can step in and our of it.
Never goes away.  Always there."<p>

Geoff Ryman's fourth novel is both a paraliterary endeavour to reclaim
Oz from Hollywood and a moving and often disturbing parable about
childhood.  The novel is made up of three linked stories: in 1875,
Dorothy's parents die of a diphtheria epidemic in St. Louis and she is
packed off to her aunt in the tiny settler town of Manhattan in
Kansas.  She cannot adjust to the poverty and hardship of frontier
life, nor to the puritan ethic that Aunt Em (who means well, but is
unable to show any affection for Dorothy) attempts to instil in her,
and she is sexually abused by her uncle.  She runs away to the Wichita
(looking for Oz?), but cannot escape from the tragedy of her life,
becoming a prostitute, alcoholic, violent, and is finally locked up in
a mental hospital.  "Oh, Dorothy!" cries the reader, "Where was Oz
when you needed it most?"  "There's no place like home," the film has
Dorothy saying, and the irony is painfully cruel.<p>

One of Ryman's many sources, quoted in the chapter headings, describes
the flight from the failed farmlands of the American West: "By the end
of the nineteenth century, country towns had become
charnel&#173;houses and the countries that surrounded them had become
places of dry bones.  The land and its farms were filled with the
guilty voices of women mourning for their children and the aimless
mutterings of men asking about jobs...  The people who left the land
came to the cities not to get jobs, but to be free from them, not to
get work but to be entertained, not to be masters but to be charges.
They followed yellow brick roads to emerald cities presided over by
imaginary wizards who would permit them to live in happy adolescence
for the rest of their lives..."  [Michael Lesy, <cite>Wisconsin Death
Trip</cite>] Where was Oz for all these people?<p>

In 1927, Judy Garland (nee Frances Gumm) is the youngest and most
talented of three performing sisters, singing in her parents'
movie&#173;house, being pushed onto the stage in Los Angeles and
watching nervously as her gay father and unfaithful mother attempt to
keep up the pretence of a normal family.  By the time she stars in
<cite>The Wizard of Oz</cite>, she no longer has a home to return
to.<p>

In 1956 disturbed child Jonathan sees <cite>The Wizard of Oz</cite> on
its first television showing.  In 1989, dying of AIDS, he learns by
chance that Baum had based his books on a real Dorothy whom he met in
Kansas in the late nineteenth century, and sets out to find where she
lived - and to look for Oz.<p>

In Ryman's novel, L. Frank Baum appears briefly as a substitute
teacher at Dorothy's school, and is so horrified at his pupil's wasted
life that he writes the Oz books as if to say, it could have been
different.  The people of Kansas have trouble with Baum's East Coast
accent, and think that his name is Balm - and certainly Ryman casts
the novelist in the role of a healer, for one of Ryman's theses seems
to be this: that Baum created Oz as a gift that children who were
unhappy at home could escape to, a land that was always marvellous and
exciting, but in which you could never come to any harm, and which you
never had to leave; <cite>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</cite> was never
intended to carry the heavy moral authority of the film, never
intended to show that Oz is a terrifying and dangerous place or that
home is best and that girls should never leave to seek adventure.  In
Baum's novel, the good sorceress Glinda gives Dorothy a magic kiss on
her forehead to protect her from all harm, but this is absent from the
film: "Gradually Jonathan realized that in the movie, the kiss was not
a spell.  The kiss would not protect Dorothy.  She could be hurt.  It
was television, frightening again."<p>

Baum's message was not understood - or perhaps understood well enough
- by adult Americans.  "<cite>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</cite> was
kept off most public library shelves until the 1960s because
librarians considered it hackwork." [Aljean Harmetz, <cite>The Making
of the Wizard of Oz</cite>] "The hostility to the Oz books was itself
something of a phenomenon...  It is significant that one of the most
brutal attacks on the Oz books was made by the director of the Detroit
Library system, who found the Oz books to have `a cowardly approach to
life'.  They are also guilty of `negativism'.  Worst of all, `there is
nothing elevating or uplifting about the Baum series'.  For the
Librarian of Detroit, courage and affirmation meant punching the clock
and then doing the dull work of a machine while never questioning the
system." [Gore Vidal, `The Oz Books']<p>

How successful is Was?  We are on Orson Scott Card territory here -
the characters' lives depicted here are so painful that we cannot but
feel moved by them - and Ryman has, like Card, a combination of gentle
wisdom, love for and piercing insight into his characters.  Perhaps it
is overdone in places, but <cite>Was</cite> remains a powerful and
assured piece of work, and certainly a candidate for the year's best
novel.<p>

Postscript (April 92).  After listening to Ryman talk about the novel,
it seems that my interpretation of the novel is wrong - or at least it
does not concur with his, and certainly Ryman is wiser than I.  My own
interpretation was that Dorothy cannot find Oz, but can only go on
searching for it by becoming insane.  Ryman said that Dorothy
<em>does</em> find Oz; it is we who label her as `mad'.  Much as I
wished for a happy ending to the novel, I cannot agree with him; I do
not have such a romantic view of madness.<p>



<Hr><A Name="anvilofs"><H2>Anvil of Stars (Greg Bear)</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

In <cite>The Forge of God</cite>, to which the book at hand is the
sequel, Earth was attacked and destroyed by self&#173;replicating von
Neumann machines which were manufactured and sent by a predatory alien
race known throughout <cite>Anvil of Stars</cite> as `The Killers' and
attracted to the Solar System by the human race's innocent outpouring
of radio waves.  A few thousand humans were rescued by another set of
von Neumann machines, sent by beneficial aliens called `The
Benefactors'. It seems that a few of the more advanced civilisations
in the galaxy have put together a galactic Law, of which the salient
portion rules that `All civilisations responsible for the manufacture
of self&#173;replicating and destructive devices will be destroyed.'
Another clause requires that the victims of killer machines should
take charge of the extermination of their killers, and so about one
hundred of Earth's surviving teenagers volunteer for the mission of
vengeance in the Benefactor&#173;provided spaceship that they christen
<cite>Dawn Treader</cite>.<p>

The picture of galactic society painted here is extremely bleak: with
planet&#173;destroying technologies easily available, advanced
civilisations hide in fear of violent and agressive intelligences,
taking great care to hide every trace of their presence by shielding
all radio emissions and by concealing totally all information about
what they are like, and where there home star is.  Meanwhile, the
aggressive intelligences build their self&#173;replicating machines to
destroy unwary young intelligent races, and live in such terror of the
Law that condemns them and all their descendants to extermination that
they turn entire star systems into traps and decoys.<p>

Bleak, yes, but as the crew of the <cite>Dawn Treader</cite>
degenerate into <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>&#173;style
power&#173;play, mysticism and violence, Greg Bear seems to be
suggesting that we have no reason to hope for anything better.<p>

Given that the novel attempts to describe civilisations immeasurably
more advanced, technologically and socially, than ourselves, it is not
surprising that Bear fails to be completely convincing, but some
subeditor should have caught the truly dreadful names (for example,
one of the aliens is called `Dry Skin/Norman'.  I kid you not!).  On
the plus side, <cite>Anvil of Stars</cite> is a well&#173;paced
exciting adventure story, with super&#173;science to rival anything
doc Smith ever thought up.<p>



<Hr><A Name="aliensex"><H2>Alien Sex (edited by Ellen Datlow)</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

"When men in sf films say `It's a strange alien life form like nothing
we've met before, and we can't possibly understand it'," says Gwyneth
Jones, talking about her new novel White Queen, "what I hear is
`Women!  Who can understand them?' "  Well, that's Alien Sex
deconstructed, right?<p>

Well, not really.  Ellen Datlow's new collection is full of
sophisticated and intelligent stories that bear this kind of analysis
lightly.<p>

Of course there's fluff too, but even that is mostly delightful.
There's Larry Niven's oft&#173;reprinted `Man of Steel, Woman of
Kleenex', about the problems of conceiving a child when your sperm are
faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive;
Philip Jose Farmer wonders what Tarzan would have been like if it had
been written by William rather than Edgar Rice in `The Jungle Rot Kid
on the Nod'; Geoff Ryman describes a universe dedicated to fucking
itself in `Omnisexual'; Roberta Lannes parodies the anthology's theme
in her hilarious `Saving the World at the New Moon Motel', Harlan
Ellison supplies a rather disappointing dirty joke `How's the Night
Life on Cissalda', and Scott Baker pads out the pages with the dull
and unreconstructed `The Jamesburg Incubus'.<p>

Among the serious stories, two authors comment on the nasty side of
male&#173;female politics using the human&#173;alien metaphor, K W
Jeter in `The First Time' and Michaela Roessner in `Picture Planes';
there are variations on the demon lover by Richard Matheson and Lewis
Shiner; three stories take as a theme the destructive effect of the
cargo culture induced by the appearance on Earth of vastly superior
aliens; `War Bride' by Rick Wilbur, `When the Fathers Go' by Bruce
McAllister and `And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side'
by James Tiptree Jr.  The stories which approach the alien sex theme
best are `Dancing Chickens' by Ed Bryant and `Roadside Rescue' by Pat
Cadigan which go beyond merely sex with aliens to consider kinds of
activity which humans might have trouble recognising as sex.  Leigh
Kennedy supplies `Her Furry Face', a story about a failed
relationship, Lisa Tuttle provides original and interesting
speculations on the role of gender in `Husbands' and Pat Murphy has
some kooky theories about the future of evolution in `Love and Sex
Among the Invertebrates'.<p>

The most challenging of the stories here, and worth the price alone,
is Connie Willis' controversial `All My Darling Daughters'.  In the
story, genetic engineering has produced a creature called a `tessel',
which is essentially a living vagina, whose attraction to the male
characters in the story is not only that it is incapable of defending
itself, but that when penetrated, it emits a scream "the sound a woman
must make when she is being raped.  No.  Worse.  The sound a child
might make."  You can see why such a story might prove controversial.
Male critics, notably Orson Scott Card, have accused Willis of being
anti&#173;male, and avowed that they could never find anything
attractive about the tessel.  Female critics have found more to
disagree about.  Mari Kotari, writing in issue 9 of <cite>Science
Fiction Eye</cite>, argues that since the tessel reduces sexual
vulnerability to its essential form, the story provides a reductio ad
absurdam demonstration that vulnerability does not define or
constitute femininity; that it is something alien.  "Just as the
tessel uncovered its users' sexual politics rather than its own
identity, so the textuality of `All My Darling Daughters' unveils the
reader's own political sexuality."<p>

A book titled <cite>Alien Sex</cite> could have become an anthology of
pornography, but Datlow has instead assembled an almost uniformly
excellent collection of entertaining and intelligent stories.<p>



<Hr><A Name="halotomm"><H2>Halo (Tom Maddox)</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

Tom Maddox has a reputation as a staunch advocate of the cyberpunk
genre as the best, indeed the only, direction for sf, and as a critic
of writers like Shiner and Sterling who, after providing the driving
impetus of cyberpunk in the mid&#173;80s, felt (wisely, in this
reviewer's opinion) that in order to mature as writers they needed to
move on.  So now that we have Maddox's first novel in our hands, the
question is: can he put his writing where his mouth is?<p>

In the opening chapters we run through all the cyberpunk themes -
information economy, powerful scheming multi&#173;national
corporations, exotic east Asian setting (there's even a Zen Master who
seems to spend all his time in zazen or dishing out Zen platitudes),
cities in orbit, emerging artificial intelligence - as SenTrax
official Gonzales performs an `information audit' on a corrupt Burmese
bureaucrat who then tries to have him assassinated, returns to the US
in shock at his close brush with death, gets assigned to escort
computer scientist Diana Heywood to L5 colony Halo, run by the
slowly&#173;awakening artificial intelligence Aleph.  At which point,
the genre trappings, the (rather feeble) corporate machinations, even
the central character Gonzales, fade into the background and the novel
focuses on its central concern, the strengthening selfhood and
approaching transcendental intelligence of Aleph.<p>

Maddox has been accused of fine writing (`hyper&#173;literate' exudes
William Gibson on the cover; `literate as hell' write Paul McAuley in
a review), and certainly he is self&#173;consciously literate, with
erratic success.  There are moments of poetry, but too often of bathos
- some of the dialogue is truly dreadful.  Maddox is adept at
describing his robots, machine intelligences and orbital habitats,
less so when it comes to his rather cardboard characters and their
interactions.<p>

It's not that <cite>Halo</cite> is a bad book, it's just that Maddox
is too weighed down by the genre he champions to emerge from it.  And
there is some evidence that there's a real writer struggling to emerge
from this book's pages.  Don't spend your money yet, but do watch this
space.<p>



<Hr><A Name="divinein"><H2>Divine Invasions: A Life Of Philip K Dick
(Lawrence Sutin)</H2></A>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

There's something fascinating about the tortured genius, the great
artist who suffers for his or her work - and perhaps something a
little moralistic in the implication that you can't have it all, that
you can't produce great art and have a happy, contented, successful
life.<p>

Perhaps the case for Philip K Dick's status as a great artist still
has to be proven (I am in no doubt on this score - Dick mined the
trash of pulp fiction, religious cults and conspiracy theory to
produce astonish gems of literature: he possessed something of William
Burroughs' paranoid vision, but with infinitely more love for his
characters, those ordinary people trying to survive in the face of
oppressive bosses or governments, and often the total breakdown of
reality), but there can be no doubt as to his suffering.  Sutin
carefully details the troubles of Dick's life - his hate for his
mother (on whose support he depended many times in his life), his
passionate courtships and inability to hold down a relationship for
long (he was married five times), his drug habit (he used - prescribed
- amphetamines and tranquilisers in vast quantities to control his
moods and allow him to write at ferocious speed), his suicide attempts
and his theological agonising, but never forgets why Dick's life is so
fascinating to us.  Of the rejection of the seven mainstream novels he
wrote in the fifties, Sutin writes "It was an anguish to him.  And out
of that anguish his best work would come."  And of Dick's intense
religious visions of February and March 1974 (and which he struggled
heroically and unsuccessfully to explain for the rest of his life,
said struggle filling more than 7,000 pages of journal - Sutin prints
one extraordinary story from this <cite>Exegesis</cite> in which Dick
is tormented by a God who is responsible for his visions but by whose
very nature is immune to and beyond any explanation), "As
<cite>Valis</cite> proved, it was, whatever else you will, a great
idea for a novel."<p>

Lawrence Sutin remains somewhat detached from his subject throughout
the book, the cool tone a contrast with some Dickian eulogies, but
that is to his credit, for Dick is clearly a difficult person to write
about.  Not only, it seems, was he possessed of an incredibly
energetic, intelligent and warm personality, but his own versions of
his life often (when they are not already self&#173;contradictory)
contrast dramatically with those of his friends and family.  It seems
that he never stopped fictionalising, quite unconsciously, his life
story, and Sutin proceeds through this minefield with admirable care,
backing up or contradicting Dick's own accounts with those of people
close to him, and itemising his sources meticulously.<p>

How much can Philip K Dick's life tell us about his novels?  Sutin
provides two different views of Dick's on the subject: "It is one of
the cardinal errors of literary criticism to believe that the author's
own views can be inferred from his writing." and "People have told me
that everything about me, every facet of my life, psyche, experiences,
dreams and fears are laid out explicitly in my writing, that from the
corpus of my work I can be absolutely and precisely inferred.  This is
true."  Certainly it is the case that his novels drew heavily on his
life for their raw materials, for characters, places and dilemmas,
even for their metaphysical paradoxes.  But isn't this true of any
serious writer?  Sutin points to the many correspondances between life
and art, but he is not in the business of explaining, nor should we
be.  <cite>Divine Invasions</cite> is, dare I say it, an essential
book.  Read it.  (And if you haven't read the masterpieces <cite>A
Scanner Darkly</cite>, <cite>Flow my Tears, the Policeman Said</cite>,
or <cite>Valis</cite>, perhaps this book will persuade you.)<p>



<Hr><A Name="takeback"><H2>Take Back Plenty (Colin Greenland)</H2></A>

<H3>Helen Steele</H3>

Colin Greenland's <cite>Take Back Plenty</cite> has won three awards,
including the Arthur C Clarke Award 1991, and they were well deserved
for <cite>Take Back Plenty</cite> is a splendid book.  Set in the
future and based in our own solar system it is one of the new breed of
space opera for the 1990s.  Unlike earlier authors of space operas,
Greenland, like Iain M Banks and Dan Simmons, has brought a touch of
grit into his writing, reflecting his position as a
post&#173;cyberpunk writer.<p>

His space opera still has space ships (though the main protagonist's
ship is now a dirty cargo ship), aliens (nasty and bizarre) and
strange and difficult environments, yet there is something more:
Greenland is not an `ideas' writer like so many other space opera
authors; his characters are as real and colourful as any you could
read about.  The main protagonist of <cite>Take Back Plenty</cite> is
Tabitha Jute, the captain of the cargo ship `Alice Liddell' who gets
into all sorts of trouble after taking on some strange passengers -
trouble that includes space pirates, bounty hunters, crashing on Venus
and aliens, thought long dead, proving to be very much alive.  It is
all told with such an eye for pace and humour that it is a true joy to
read and I feel I can heartily recommend it.<p>



<Hr><A Name="crowroad"><H2>The Crow Road (Iain Banks)</H2></A>

<H3>Helen Steele</H3>

Ever since the publication of the controversial <cite>The Wasp
Factory</cite> in the early eighties Iain Banks has been seen as a
writer of mainstream horror, an afficionado of black humour and
eccentricity.  This has led to comparison, often unfavourable, with
other authors of his generation - Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Ian
McEwan - but that these comparisons cannot be truly valid is amply
demonstrated by his new novel <cite>The Crow Road</cite>.  For the
fact is that Banks cannot write like the best of his peers - his prose
does not delight, the construction of his novel does not amaze -
instead his novel has something else, a heart.<p>

The chief protagonist of <cite>The Crow Road</cite> is Prentice
McHoan, a young Scot on the verge of manhood and understanding, and it
is through his eyes that much of the story is seen.  Banks often uses
a narrator who is either a child (Frank in <cite>The Wasp
Factory</cite>) or someone who is childlike, has yet to reach the
understanding, the stasis of adulthood, and is thus more naive,
grasping for knowledge, and more combative, fighting against the
forces of the establishment.  This choice serves him well in <cite>The
Crow Road</cite> - Prentice makes an ideal protagonist, intelligent
and full of dark humour, yet not without many faults - his infatuation
for the divine Verity, his jealousy of his brother, his argument with
his father - which all form part of the tale.<p>

The story is essentially that of two generations of the McHoans and
their sprawling family of eccentrics: Prentice's father, Kenneth;
Kenneth's brothers, the missing Rory and the religious Hamish; and his
brother in law, the rich yet troubled Fergus are just some of the
wonderful characters Banks draws for us in a text based on flashback
and a contemporary narrative.  These characters and the land where
they live and die make <cite>The Crow Road</cite> special, for it is
clear that Banks <em>feels</em> for the people he writes about and
understands them and their motives.  It is this skill that some of the
`best' of his generation often lack, and though Banks is not as
literate or as polished as his peers he still has a certain spark, an
eye for the horrific and the darkly humourous (here used to much
better effect than in his previous novels), all of which make
<cite>The Crow Road</cite> his best novel yet.<p>



<hr><A Name="tonrepor"><H2>Ton Report</H2></A>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

On the first Thursday of every month science fiction fans gather to
London's Wellington Arms for purposes of communication.  Your CUSFS
roving reporter, with no previous experience, investigated this sf
beano of bonhomie and like&#173;minded people.  What was it like?
Like entering university again for the first time, with one difference
- there were apparently no other new bugs in the same position.  All
the cliques had already formed, everyone knew others from attending
endless conventions and indeed most were either regulars or had made
special arrangements to meet people.  Old friends - I'm afraid - take
precedence over newcomers to our favourite genre and its world of
official fans.  If you're not one of that distinctive
self&#173;devouring breed, then meetings at the Ton will not and
indeed are not intended to welcome you.  If you are, you'll meet lots
of old mates.  If you do not go for t&#173;shirts, loud behaviour,
laughable facial hair and communal jokes you will not even like the
atmosphere.<p>

Sf fandom is indeed the natural place for those who love sf, its
images and ideas, but to enter it it is wiser to visit a convention or
two to see if you like the people.  It is wiser still to go to one
with people you know, although fandom is welcoming enough to people
who make the effort to participate in it.  Participation, however,
will not bring you anything in the way of a deeper enjoyment or
understanding of science fiction, nor will it broaden your reading or
your mind in ways that you cannot with a little effort encourage for
yourself, as it has to be said that the taste of most fans is
lamentably poor and unthinking.  Yet participation will bring you lots
of new friends and new social interests if you do not have enough
already.  Perhaps it is the place for you, although the Ton is not the
place to start.<p>

Don't let me put you off.<p>



<hr><A Name="upthespo"><H2>Up The Spout: An Obituary of Frankie
Howard</H2></A>

<H3>Simon Pick</H3>

Frankie Howard's untimely death at the age of 70 has robbed the
science&#173;fiction and fantasy field of one of its most consummate
and original practitioners - the more so since he appeared to be at
least 130 and so in his very person seemed to prove the existence of
life&#173;extending systems or drugs of the sort that
science&#173;fiction has been predicting for years.  Indeed, to look
at him he may well have been older than the genre of
science&#173;fiction itself, and thus have spanned its evolution in a
way no other individual contributor can hope to match.  Indeed, where
Frankie Howard was concerned, `individual' was always the key word.
Who else can have hoped to present the basic tenets of Fantasy
literature in such an insistent, humanitarian fashion?  In his classic
film, `Up Pompeii', we have it all - a basic, uncaring lack of
historical example leading to a free&#173;floating idealised milieu; a
vast quantity of naked and semi&#173;naked women, always a necessity;
and all the characters we have come to recognise and love - brainless
muscled heroes, nubile vamps who can hold their own when it comes to a
tussle, and always, of course, the role Frankie made his own - the
cunning trickster, the behind&#173;the&#173;scenes plotmaster who
ingratiates us all with his knowing ways and who wisely manipulates
the idiots about him.  Films such as `Up Pompeii' and its sequels,
which include `Up the Chastity Belt' (a movie of knights and their
nights which is a paradigm for any number of later `armour and amour'
schlockers) have laid the pattern for all the important later
movements in fantasy and sf, from TSR to Raymond E Feist - and what
else is such sf as Marion Z Bradley but Raymond E Feist with extra
spaceships?  His acts in performance were a joy to us all, brimming
with ideas; it is little wonder that they have influenced the field
across the genres.  What else were his stage shows but an ingenious
concoction of sound effects with weak jokes for comic relief? it is
obvious that such efforts as Willow and Star Trek IV have them as
their blueprint.  In all honesty, we must all regret the passing of
Frankie Howard as a unique performer and - it's true - a genuinely
funny man.<p>

<h3>compiled by `Wizzo'</h3>

<cite>ttba</cite> is proud to present `It's a Fact', a new regular
column featuring amusing, incredible and all completely TRUE FACTS
from the wonderful world of science.<p>

Jumpin' Jack Daniels, famous pop&#173;star of the band New Teenage
Kicks, who last had a hit record in 1973 with their glam&#173;rock
classic Sugar Overload, in 1986 persuaded doctors to equip him with
reversable hormones.  At the time he told reporters, "I'm cheesed with
all this tabloid speculation over my personal relationships.  From now
on I'm in a multi&#173;optional situation."  This radical technique of
radiation therapy means that, after an injection of the correct
enzymes, Jumpin' Jack is able to switch his sexual orientation
whichever way he wishes, to find either women or men attractive, but
not both at the same time.  Since 1986 he has personally sued popular
publications seventeen times, each time successfully, for making
allegations about his sex life and orientation.  If they claim he is
gay, he can prove in court that he is straight, and vice versa.  Says
Jack, "If everyone had reversable hormones, the world would be a more
wonderful place."  It's a Fact!<p>

James Bradley Scurf of NY state, USA, twenty&#173;seven years of age
and now employed as a car mechanic, was born with the sexual pleasure
circuits of his brain connected by misplaced nerve ends to his throat.
Bizarre but true, while James received no pleasure from intercourse,
all feeling in his palate and throat was perceived by his brain as
being sexual in nature.  He would mystify all his friends by turning
up to parties, getting very drunk and repeatedly throwing up.  This
constant behaviour was not, as they thought, lack of self&#173;control
but merely an attempt to achieve sexual fulfillment.  A doctor writes,
"Being the fast movement of liquid expelled from the body through a
narrow tube, for men at least the principle is identical for both
processes."  James Bradley Scurf has been speechless since May 1987,
when friends fed him his first vindaloo.  It's a Fact!<p>

As part of its pro&#173;life drive, the latest issue of fundamentalist
journal `Christian Pedagogue' has come out firmly against modern
medicine, affirming the right of diseases - both germs and viral
infections - to live on God's earth with the same rights and hopes of
salvation as any other living thing.  "If we visit a doctor," affirms
the editorial, "we not only fight against the extra life in our bodies
which God has seen fit to bless us with and thus against God's
inevitable Will, we also seek to murder the living disease which
through the goodness of our hearts we let ride in us so that it too
may multiply and experience the beauty of God's creation.  All have a
right to life in the sight of the Lord."  In California, a mental
`Channeller' has made psychic contact with an influenza virus living
in her body and is now offering seminars instructing the influenza's
timeless wisdom as seen as `Life on the InSide'.  The virus has much
to say on the subject of the Universe of Love in which we live and the
bonds of Psychic Love which bind as all and give us our own special
role within the world whole, but has also come out firmly against
tightening the gun laws.  It's a Fact!<p>

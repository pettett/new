<h1>The (Incomplete) Rules of Sprodzoom</h1>

Compiled by Gareth Rees and Simon Arrowsmith<p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

Sprodzoom is a multi-player game played (historically) by CUSFS and Trinity
Mathematical Society.  It is suitable both as a drinking game (with penalties)
and as a complex spectator sport.<p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Main Concepts</h2>

A <strong>Conversation</strong> takes place between two players and has an
<strong>Active</strong> and a <strong>Passive</strong> end.  In general, the
player at the active end is "due to speak" (i.e. to make a gesture).<p>

A <strong>Gesture</strong> is the basic component of Sprodzoom, and is any
motion of the hands or body that might have some meaning in the game.  The
player who makes a gesture will be referred to as the <strong>Actor</strong>.
A gesture may be <strong>Directed</strong>, that is, pointed at another player
in the game.  A gesture may not be directed at the actor.  The player thus
pointed at will be referred to as the <strong>Recipient</strong>.<p>

A conversation has a <strong>Label</strong> (i.e. a gesture not pre-defined in
the game), to enable it to be distinguished from other conversations that may
be in progress.  In most cases, a label precedes a gesture to form a move in
the conversation selected by that label.  A label may be
<strong>Pending</strong> if a conversation has been created but not labelled.
In this case the active player in that conversation must label it (using the
Moradice gesture, see below) before making any other gesture.  The label of the
first conversation in a game is the <strong>Null</strong> label.<p>

To <strong>Reply</strong> in a conversation is to swap the active and passive
ends of that conversation.<p>


<hr>

<h2>3. Definitions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Gestures</strong></dt>
<dd>The set of all gestures.</dd>

<dt><strong>Labels</strong></dt>
<dd>The set of permissible labels; all gestures not predefined.</dd>

<dt><strong>Players</strong></dt>
<dd>The set of players currently in the game.</dd>

<dt><strong>Conversations</strong>
<dd>The set of conversations in progress (initially Conversations is empty).  A
conversation is a triple (a,p,l) where a is the active participant, p the
passive participant and l the label.  Different conversations must have
different labels.</dd>

<dt><strong>active(c)</strong></dt>
<dd>The active participant in conversation c.</dd>

<dt><strong>passive(c)</strong></dt>
<dd>The passive participant in conversation c.</dd>

<dt><strong>label(c)</strong></dt>
<dd>The label of conversation c.</dd>

<dt><strong>left(p)</strong></dt>
<dd>The player sitting to the left of player p.</dd>

<dt><strong>right(p)</strong></dt>
<dd>The player sitting to the right of player p.</dd>

<dt><strong>reply(c)</strong></dt>
<dd>The conversation produced by replying in the conversation c, i.e., the
conversation (passive(c), active(c), label(c)).</dd>

<dt><strong>+</strong></dt>
<dd>The operator that concatenates two gestures.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>4. You are in error if</h2>
<ul>
<li>You make a gesture with the incorrect syntax, or make a gesture when it is
not legal to do so.</li>

<li>You end up talking to yourself, or cause someone to be talking to themself
(the Rule of Sanity).</li>

<li>You create two conversations with the same label (the Rule of Ambiguity).</li>

<li>You at the active end of a conversation for more than thirty seconds (Rule
32).</li>
</ul>

When a player is in error, the conversation in which the illegal move was made
comes to an end.  It is traditional for other players in a game to direct
wergs (see below) at a player who is in error.<p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Pre-defined Gestures</h2>

Where appropriate, c (and d) stand for the
conversation(s) in which the gesture takes place, actor is the
player making the gesture and recipient is the person at whom the
gesture is directed.

<h3>Fortnum</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A tweak of the left ear-lobe.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Fortnum<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: At any time.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: open quote.  All subsequent gestures (until a mason is
performed by the actor) have no effect in any conversation.

<h3>Mason</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A tweak of the right ear-lobe.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Mason<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: if the actor has made a fortnum but not yet provided a
closing mason at that level (fortnum and mason may be nested).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: See fortnum.

<h3>Werg (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A pawing motion with both hands.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Werg<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When the recipient is in error.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: None.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: It is traditional to direct wergs at players who are in
error, in order that they realise this.  There is no special penalty (other
than general ridicule) for making a werg in error.

<h3>Sprod (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Left hand swings forward from the shoulder in a
pointing motion.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Sprod<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When no game is in progress.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Starts a game with empty Conversations and Players
containing only actor and recipient.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: There's little use in starting a game with no
conversations.  Use a sprodzoom instead.

<h3>Zoom (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Right hand swings forward from the shoulder in a
pointing motion.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Zoom<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When a game with no conversations is in progress.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets Conversations to contain only the conversation
(recipient,actor,NULL).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Used to continue a game in which all conversations have
been destroyed (typically by their participants being in error).

<h3>Sprodzoom (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A sprod and a zoom combined in a single,
double-handed pointing motion.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Sprodzoom<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When no game is in progress.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Starts a game with Players containing only actor and
recipient and Conversations containing only the conversation
(recipient,actor,NULL).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Games are typically started by a sprodzoom, rarely by
sprod and zoom separately.

<h3>Schwarz (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Fingers of both hands interlinked and the palms are
pushed towards the recipient.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Schwarz<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: If actor is active(c) and recipient is passive(c).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets c to reply(c).

<h3>Profigliano (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A pedalling motion with both feet.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Profigliano<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: If actor is active(c) and recipient is not
passive(c).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets c to reply(c) and adds recipient to Players.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Enters the recipient into the game, if not already in.

<h3>Neuralnic</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: The actor pats the left side of the head with right
hand, and vice versa, with arms folded over the top of the head.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Neuralnic<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: If actor is active(c) and passive(c) is not
left(actor).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets active(c) to left(actor) and sets c to
reply(c).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Transfers the actor's end of the conversation to the
left and replies in that conversation.

<h3>Pericles (directed)</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: A slow waving motion with both arms extended to the
sides, while the mouth opens and closes in a fish-like motion and the eyes are
rolled.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Pericles<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: If actor is active(c) and recipient is not
passive(c).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets active(c) to recipient and adds the conversation
(right(actor), actor, PENDING) to Conversations.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Transfers your end of the conversation to the recipient,
who then must reply in it, and also creates a conversation between you and the
player on your right, who must create a label and then reply in it.

<h3>Omsk</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Hands are clapped above the actor's head.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Omsk + label(d)<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When actor is active(c) and also active(d) and
passive(c) is not the same as passive(d).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Removes c and d from Conversations ands adds the new
conversation (passive(c), passive(d), label(c) + label(d)).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Creates a new conversation which is the join of two
others, which are removed from the game.  Compare with minsk.

<h3>Minsk</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Hands are clapped behind the actor's back.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: label(c) + Minsk + label(d)<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When actor is active(c) and active(d) and passive(c) is
also passive(d).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Removes c and d from Conversations ands adds the new
conversation (actor, passive(c), label(c) + label(d)).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Create a new conversation which is the join of two
others that have exactly the same participants, and which are removed from the
game.  Compare with omsk.

<h3>Moradice</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: The actor looks in a (possibly imaginary) inside
jacket pocket.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Moradice + label(c) + g (where g is a new gesture)<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When actor is active(c).<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Sets label(c) to g.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Change the label of the conversation.  Watch out for the
Rule of Ambiguity.

<h3>Valhalla</h3>
<strong>Gesture</strong>: Hands waved from side to side in opposite directions,
palms downwards, in front of the actor's torso.<br>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: Valhalla<br>
<strong>Legal</strong>: When a game is in progress, but preferably no
conversations.<br>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Terminates the game.<p>

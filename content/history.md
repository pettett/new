<p>The Cambridge University Science Fiction Society (CUSFS - pronounced "cuss-fuss") was established in 1963 with the goal of creating a consolidated library of books and magazines. Since then, the society has developed into a catch-all for things related to science fiction, fantasy, and other genres - like alternate history - which bear a spiritual relationship to SFF. If it is in any way relevant, we have probably discussed it, at some point or another.</p>

<p>That 'fantasy' in the last paragraph bears a little explanation. Despite the official name, we are very much the science fiction <em>and fantasy</em> society, but this is a more recent development. At some point - perhaps in 1974, or thereabouts - several members of CUSFS, in protest to what they saw as politicisation of the society (it being, at that time, involved in some sort of CUSU related campaign), formed J&oacute;msborg the New, a separate society which developed into the <em>de facto</em> fantasy society. Some twenty years later, the radical elements of CUSFS having died down, the two societies noticed they had virtually identical member lists and merged.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practice? Nothing, really. CUSFS is the overarching organisational structure; within it, J&oacute;msborg retains a nominal independence. It has its own, largely ceremonial committee; occasional meetings of the society are designated J&oacute;msmeetings, with a fantasy-themed topic and the consumption of mead; and there are a couple of traditional J&oacute;msborg annual events. But in the grand scheme of things, CUSFS is a single society with a unified membership - if, admittedly, a membership that isn't quite willing to dispense with past traditions.</p>

<h1>Early History</h1>

<p>A Fascinating record of the founding and early history of the Society can be read <a href="old/archive/early.html">here</a>. Our <a href="old/index.html">Archive</a> -- essentially the Society site as it stood before 2013 -- has lots of interesting info about the Society's history, though it's not very well organised (sorry...).</p>

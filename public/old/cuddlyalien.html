<h1>The CUSFS Cuddly Alien</h1>

<img src="CuddlyAlien2.gif" alt="That's Mr. Alien to you">

<p>The chappy above has been the CUSFS logo for as long as much of the
current membership can remember, and has survived being lost, found,
lost again, scanned off a T-shirt, and rotated, not to mention being
printed on the small bits of dead tree CUSFS uses for membership
cards.</p>

<p>A few days ago I received the following mail:</p>
<pre>
From: Jeremy Henty
To: owen@greenend.org.uk
Subject: CUSFS home page 
Date: Thu, 12 Mar 1998 16:09:20 +0000

This has absolutely made my day!  I surfed onto the CUSFS home page and
there it was!  At the top of the page!  Staring me in the face!  The
very same logo I drew for CUSFS over TEN YEARS ago!!!  

It would be really, really, really nice if you credited me for it!  

Please?  

Pretty please?  

Regards, 

Jeremy Henty (TTBA co-editor: Volume 15)

<p>So here's credit where credit's due, and many thanks to Jeremy for
drawing the logo in the first place; here's to another ten years or so!</p>

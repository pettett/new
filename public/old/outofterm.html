<h1>CUSFS - Out of Term</h1>

<p>Outside Full Term, CUSFS members often meet informally on Thursday evenings. The venue
is often the <a href="http://www.thecarltonarms.co.uk/">Carlton Arms</a> (on Carlton Way),
but please contact the CUSFS committee using <b>soc-cusfs at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk</b> for
confirmation.</p>

<p>The programme for the coming term is not yet available - it is likely to be announced
in e-mail missives and on this website nearer the time.</p>

<p>Details of past terms' programmes are available in the
<a href="archive/index.html">CUSFS archive</a>.</p>

<p id="v155GR"><b>155 Gilbert Road ("Relativity")</b><br />
From the centre of town, follow Bridge Street and Castle Street past the
Castle Inn to the top of the hill. When you reach the traffic lights, turn
right then immediately left onto Histon Road (the road with The Grapes pub
on it which goes diagonally off down the side of the former Texaco garage,
NOT the first right). Gilbert Road is some way down on the right, past the
Co-op. 155 is on the right-hand side, a shortish way down.</p>

<p id="vNHVR"><b>New Hall, Video Room</b><br />
From the town centre, head north up Castle Hill.  Keep going until you've gone past
the large and rather complex road junction at the top of the hill.  New
Hall is then on the left, down a short side road.  Go in through the main
entrance and go through the door on the right just after the Porters'
goldfish bowl (this will take you outside).  The Video Room should then be
the first door on the right.  (Bike parking at New Hall is down the ramp to
the left of the main entrance.)</p>

<p id="vPFAA24"><b>Pembroke, Foundress Court, room AA24</b><br />
Pembroke is the college on the corner of Pembroke Street and Trumpington Street;
entry is via the main gate on Trumpington Street. Foundress Court is the very
new building at the back of college, on the right as you approach from the main gate.
AA24 is on the first floor, just down the hall from the strange rock garden thing.
</p>

<p id="vCM"><b>Castle Mound</b><br />
Follow Bridge Street out of the town centre; pass the traffic lights and
walk up Castle Street. Castle Mound is on the right hand side, set back
beyond the lawn and car park, shortly after the Castle Inn. If you reach
the traffic lights by the former Texaco garage you have gone too far.

<p id="v16NW"><b>16 Nursery Walk</b><br />
Nursery Walk is a little way out of the centre of town, near Fitzwilliam
College. From the town centre head out over Magdalene Bridge up the hill,
past the Castle Mound. At the traffic lights by the Texaco garage, go
straight on along Huntingdon Road, passing New Hall. A little way after
Fitz turn right into Richmond Road - if you see Storey's Way on your left
you have gone too far. Follow Richmond Road all the way along, then turn
right into Nursery Walk. You might find
<a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=52.2196&lon=0.1094&scale=10000&icon=x">this multimap link</a> useful.</p>

<p id="v3DH"><b>3 Daniel's House, Histon Road</b><br />
Go down Histon Road away from the town centre. After 5 minutes' walk there's
a large white Tandoori on the right, called the Tandoori Palace. There are
iron gates either side; go through the one that's to the left of the restaurant
as you face it. There's a walkway to the left; go along that until you come
to the right turn after the steps, then go down that corridor to the first
set of steps that actually go somewhere, labelled '2-3 Daniel's House'. The
front door is blue and has a cat on it with "Serge and Morag please knock
loudly" written on it. There is a map on the wall to your left as you go
through the gate, but it doesn't make things very clear.</p>

<p id="v17AP"><b>17 Ashworth Park</b><br />
From the centre of town head out past the Sidgwick Site and/or the UL to
Grange Road. Turn left, and follow Grange Road south to where it meets
Barton Road. Go across the road, through the archway and across the car
park to find the block containing flats 14-27, and ring the bell for flat
17.</p>

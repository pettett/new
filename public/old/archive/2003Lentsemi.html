<p>Unofficial events to which CUSFS members are welcome.</p>

<dt id="games"><strong>Semi-detached games evenings</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Time and venue:  7.30pm at the Castle Inn for food or
                 9.00pm at Relativity (155 Gilbert Road)</p>
                 
<p>A group of CUSFS people often meet in the Castle (on Castle Hill) on a Thursday
evening for food, and then retire to Relativity for coffee, games and booze.</p>

<p>Typically, games played can include Mao (an intriguing and mysterious card game), 
Albatross (a locally-developed Whist variant with bidding), Pairs Gnostica (a 
strategy game played with tarot cards and small pointy pyramids!) and others.</p>

<p>You'd be welcome to join us.  Note also that the official CUSFS games
evening will be taking place on Sunday 16th February, and a wider variety of 
games will be played there (and bringing your own is encouraged), so if you
only turn up to one games evening please come to the official one!</p>

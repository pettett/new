Time travel; everyone's done it, from Wells in the 1890s to Star Trek in
the 1990s, but what makes a good time travel plot?  Should everything work
out right in the end, with no real effect on history - or can the
characters have a major effect on their own past? Come along and debate
four-dimensional plot arcs, deus ex continua, and whether or not an author
can shoot his own grandfather and still finish writing his work.

Come, read, and listen to others' choices of comedy in Sci-Fi and fantasy.
Intentional or otherwise, come and share your favourite giggles with others
as a bit of light relief in Easter Term.  A wonderful opportunity to wind
down, meet other members, and have a relaxing drink.

Pern is an idyllic world for those of an agrarian persuasion.
Unfortunately it is ravaged by a space-borne semi-lifeform called
`thread' which is inimical to all organic matter.  The early settlers
geneered a local flying reptiloid to produce dragons, and adopted a
feudal government system.<br />
McCaffrey's Pern is one of the most famous of modern fantasy series,
but it has been criticised for its the political and social assumptions
and undertones.<br />
Come along and discuss Pern, or any of Annie's other works.

you think he's overrated.<br />

Paul Cornell is an accomplished writer whose work includes many novels,
together with TV and audio credits including 'Seasons of Fear' for Big
Finish Productions and several episodes of 'Casualty' for the BBC. His
science fiction is unashamedly and refreshingly English, dealing with
themes of spirituality and humanity that are too often ignored in the
genre, like a hyperactive, post-modern, pagan C.S. Lewis.<br />
He will be reading from his two original science fiction novels,
<cite>Something More</cite> and the forthcoming <cite>British Summertime</cite>.

The perfect antidote to Easter-term exam-blues is the CUSFS Games
Evening - bring a game or three (SF/Fantasy theme an advantage), and
have a bit of fun.<br />
Furthermore, CUSFS will be electing 6 honorary Vice-Presidents in
accordance with the <a href="../const.html">constitution</a>. The returning
officer has decided that this year, election will be trial by combat,
with each member present being able to champion two candidates for
election. Weapons will be provided, and we don't expect anyone to be
hurt! Mail any nominations to the returning officer, Matthew Vernon.

<p>The Reeve of J&oacute;msborg the New hereby announces to all J&oacute;msvikingar and CUSFS
members details of the 2002 Veizla.</p>

<p>The menu will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Soup</li>
  <li>Pan-fried Venison Steak Banquiere<br />
      (Vegetarian: Asparagus Pancake)<br />
      Seasonal Vegetables</li>
  <li>Profiteroles with Chocolate Sauce</li>
  <li>Coffee & Mints</li>
</ul>
<p>... with a selection of wines and port. Please advise if you have any
special dietary requirements, or if you require the vegetarian option.</p>

<p>The assembled throng will be challenged by the Reeve to entertain him (and
themselves) with a haiku. The evening will also see the installation of
the new Reeve and Companions.</p>

<p>Those attending the Veizla will usually be expected to attire themselves in
fancy dress or black tie. If this may cause problems, those concerned are
welcome to discuss the matter with the Reeve, to identify suitable
alternatives.</p>

<p>The price for this annual jollification is &pound;32 for drinkers
(including mead reception) and &pound;23 for the alcoholically
disinclined. There is a fixed maximum capacity for the venue, so
anyone wishing to take part is encouraged to contact the CUSFS
Treasurer, Tom Davidson (Corpus) ASAP, with a
cheque. The deadline for bookings is <strong>Thursday 6th June</strong>.</p>

<p>The Summerthing is J&oacute;msborg's annual nautical expedition to Grantchester

<p>In a change from previous years, this event is being shared with the
<a href="http://tolkien.soc.ucam.org/">Cambridge Tolkien Society's</a> Puntmoot,
and accordingly will a) start earlier and b) <strong>require
advance booking</strong>. It starts at 11am, and will cost &pound;7 to cover punt
hire and a picnic lunch at Grantchester, plus &pound;2 for those who wish
to drink beer. Booking details (INCLUDING deadline) as for the Veizla.</p>

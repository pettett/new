<h1 id="veizla">J&oacute;msborg The New: Veizla 2003</h1>

<h3>Mead Reception</h3>
<p>The Mead Reception and Photos will take place in Selwyn College Gardens,
starting at 6:15pm on Saturday 14th June. Should it be raining then we
will have the use of Selwyn's Chadwick Room instead. There will be an
opportunity to take group photographs, so remember your camera! Directions 
are below.</p>

<h3> The Dinner</h3>
<p>This year's Veizla (the annual dinner of J&oacute;msborg the New) will be
held in the Old Combination Room of St Catharine's College at 7:30pm. The
dress code is fancy dress or black tie; contact the Reeve at the committee
address below if you are unsure whether a particular costume would be
acceptable. Attendees are encouraged to bring their soul if they have one,
and may find a pen useful.</p>

<h3>The Menu</h3>
<pre>                  Carrot, chive & orange soup

       Breast of pheasant with braised mushrooms and port sauce
                               or
          Mushroom & pepper stroganoff with wild mixed rice
                              with
             Parisienne potatoes and seasonal vegetables

                         Coffee + mints
</pre>
<p>...plus a selection of wines and port.</p>

<p>The evening will also see the
naming and inauguration of the new Reeve and companions, and all
attendees will be called upon to entertain the Reeve and assembled
company with an answer to the Reeve's Challenge.</p>

<h3>The Reeve's Challenge</h3>
<p>It is the tradition that the Reeve issues a Challenge to the
J&oacute;msvikingar, to be met as they are assembled at the Veizla.
This year's Challenge is as follows:</p>

<p>It has come to the Reeve's attention recently that a number of well
known historical and fictional figures were in fact secretly
J&oacute;msvikingar.  Each J&oacute;msviking attending the Veizla is Challenged to
find one of these secret J&oacute;msvikingar and reveal their identity at the
Veizla, with a brief explanation of the evidence collected.</p>

<h3> The Aftermath </h3>
<p>After the dinner, the party will retire to Relativity (155 Gilbert Road)
for further merriment.</p
>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Selywn College is on the south end of Grange Road, between Sidgwick
Avenue and West Road.  If you enter the college via the main archway
then the Gardens are on the other side of the court, to the left of
the chapel.  The Chadwick Room is on the right-hand side of the court
as seen from the Porters' Lodge, at the bottom of the steps leading
down from the main path, close to the large stairway leading up to the
hall.</p>

<p>St Catharine's College have advised us that the best way to find the
Old Combination Room is to ask for directions while passing through
their Porters' Lodge.</p>

<p>If you need directions on the day, then the Y Reeve will be available
by mobile telephone until everyone has arrived; refer to the most 
recent Missive for his number.</p>

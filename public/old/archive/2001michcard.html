  <td colspan="5">
This is Heffer's annual "meet the authors" event. At least a dozen authors
are lined up to talk about their work (and sign books, if asked), including:
<ul>
  <li>Neal Asher</li>
  <li>Pat Cadigan</li>
  <li>Simon Clark</li>
  <li>Paul Cornell</li>
  <li>Graham Edwards</li>
  <li>Colin Greenland</li>

  <li>Gwyneth Jones</li>
  <li>Miller Lau</li>
  <li>Juliet McKenna</li>
  <li>Justina Robson</li>
  <li>Michael Scott Rohan</li>
  <li>Jan Siegel</li>
  <li>Sally Spedding</li>
  <li>Jane Welch</li>
</ul>
This has been a very popular event in previous years, and looks like being
just as good again.<br />
Fabulous Harbours is a ticket-only event; the tickets can be obtained, FREE,
from the front desk at Heffer's.<br />
We are hoping some of the authors will join us in the pub afterwards; as a
one-off, the social meeting will move from New Hall to the Castle Inn.

The author of the Culture books probably needs no introduction. But what
about his non-Culture SF (or is it?), let alone his mainstream fiction? And
how much do we really know about the Culture, when much of what we see is
the raw edges? Wax lyrical, or ask the awkward questions if you want to know more.

Local SF author and fan, Colin Greenland, will read from and talk about his
work. We also hope that his partner, Susanna Clarke, will read from her
recent work, as published in the Starlight anthologies.<br />
Speaker meetings are always enjoyable, and this one comes highly recommended.

  <td colspan="5">
Lewis Carroll is arguably one of the foremost writers of children's fantasy and
humorous "nonsense". Why are <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> and <cite>Through the 
Looking Glass</cite> still enjoyed by children over a century after they were written?
Is Alice more than just an impulsive brat? Did the blade that killed the Jabberwock have
to be vorpal?<br />
Come along and talk about this classic author, or discover what you've been missing.<br />
See this <a href="20011118miss.html">J&oacute;msmissive</a> for a flavour of Carroll's work.

Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series is space opera set in a
universe with a wide variety of distinct planetary cultures and
featuring a vivid cast of characters who develop significantly over
the course of the series.  Would you rather live on Barrayar or Beta
Colony?  Do you like Miles Vorkosigan or find him annoyingly
hyperactive and manipulative?  Come along and discover this popular author.

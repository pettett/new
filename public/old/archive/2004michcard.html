  <td colspan="5">
Iain (M.) Banks has written both thrillers (without the M) and
<a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Iain_M._Banks">SF novels</a>
(with it); we shall be discussing both varieties of his books. Many of his SF
novels are set in a universe known as 'the Culture', where sentient machines run
everything and people can do anything and everything you could possibly
imagine (which sounds very dull and boring!). The stories are set on the
'edges' of this universe though, providing activity for the protagonists
and readers! The thrillers are best described as "gothic horror". Don't
feel you have to know Banks' work to attend; come along if only to have a
chat and escape from work on a rainy Sunday evening!

Our noble and intrepid Chairbeing is leading an expedition to Yippee
Noodles Bar this coming Wednesday. If you wish to join us, please email
the committee by lunchtime on Tuesday so that we can book a table. This
is an opportunity for old CUSFS members to catch up after the summer and
for freshers to get to know the rest of the society. It should be a nice
evening; we hope to see you there!

  <td colspan="5">
A discussion where everyone will have an opinion.... Come along and
encounter feuds being born and friendships ended as people reveal their
favourite author, laying their souls open before the weekly CUSFS
discussion. Whether you want to revel in the popularity of the likes of
Pratchett or Tolkien or promote a little known author whom you consider
worthy of adoration - then this is the discussion to do it at! Alternatively
it's worth coming along and sitting quietly at the back, just to hear the
advice of others and build up that reading list into treble figures
again.....

<p>The gyptian boat was gliding silently through the night when Serafina
Pekkala's goose d&aelig;mon returned. Lyra, peering through the porthole of
her tiny cabin, watched it arrive and leave again, rising majestically
into the sky on powerful grey wings. There was a knock on her cabin door,
and Farder Coram entered, followed by his beautiful cat d&aelig;mon.</p>
<p>"We must return to Fen City and hide for a few days," he told her. "It
is dangerous to continue. Can the alethiometer tell us the nature of
the danger?"</p>
<p>Lyra pulled the alethiometer out from under her pillow and hunched over it,
bundled up in her bedclothes. Pantalaimon changed to a mouse and nestled
on her shoulder. She set the alethiometer's hands to the baby, which meant
the future, and the horse, for a journey, and the owl, for danger. She
concentrated, and immediately its hands swung away to reveal the answer.</p>
<p>"It's not very clear," she said. "There's talking, lots of people discussing
something, but I can't tell what, and a book ... no, several books, and tea
and coffee and long orange scarves? Oh, this is hopeless!" She dropped
the alethiometer onto the bed in dismay.</p>
<p>"Do not worry, child," said Farder Coram. "Serafina Pekkala said we
should seek the committee; they will be able to aid us, whatever the
danger is."</p>
<p>"How will we find them?" asked Pantalaimon.</p>
<p>"Serafina Pekkala said they are currently to be found in Fen City;
Clough 227, Newnham College, to be exact."</p>
<p>"But that's miles away!" exclaimed Lyra. "How soon can we get there?"</p>
<p>Farder Coram squinted at the stars and considered a while before speaking.
"7:30 on Sunday, by my reckoning."</p>
<p>"Perfect," said Lyra, and went to find her scarf.</p>

Explosions galore! Come and help CUSFS <em>ooh!</em> and <em>aah!</em> at
the annual Cambridge firework display on Midsummer Common. We will meet
outside the Fort St. George pub at 7:00 prompt, in time to find a good 
firework-viewing location before the fireworks start at 7:30. Look out for 
long orange scarves! (It's usually VERY busy and latecomers will be 
unlikely to find us. You have been warned.) After the display we will head 
to the Carlton Arms on Carlton Way (10-15 minutes walk) to warm up again.

<p>The perfect antidote to Fifth Week Blues. Bring a game, or come and play 
someone else's. Games old, new and very very silly will be played. 
Hopefully, we will also be holding last year's delayed election of CUSFS 
vice-presidents, by a top-secret method to be revealed nearer the time.</p>
<p>There will also be a chance to look through the library sale books. We 
have several hundred spare SF and fantasy books for sale, so come prepared 
to grab yourself a bargain or three...</p>

  <td colspan="5">
Having published some 50 novels, 150 stories and 3 volumes of poetry,
<a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Roger_Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>
is considered to be one of the most important writers of the 'New
Wave' of science fiction. Zelazny won the prestigious Hugo and
Nebula Awards (among others) on a large number of occasions; his more famous
works include <cite>The Chronicles of Amber</cite> series and <cite>Wizard World</cite> sequence.
An unusual author whose work often reflected his scholarly background in
Jacobean literature, Zelazny is well worth giving up a Sunday evening to
chat about!

<p>With the exception of those living in a cave on Pluto who receive CUSFS
weekly missives by carrier pigeon, it is unlikely to have escaped anyone's
attention that the 'original' 
<cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?tt=on;mx=20;q=star%20wars">Star Wars</a></cite>
trilogy was recently released on
DVD. Representing George Lucas' latest attempt at what still seems to be a
work in progress, the films nonetheless remain greatly entertaining
classics. Come and join CUSFS as we journey to a galaxy far, far away for
an evening in the company of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and
Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Just don't mention Episodes I to III.</p>

  <td colspan="5">
<a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>
was an exceptionally prolific author who wrote or edited over
500 books. He is perhaps best known for his robot stories (as well as the
famous 'Foundation' series) and for inventing the Three Laws of Robotics
(safeguards built into his robots' brains to prevent them from turning on
their creators). He also wrote a great deal of non-fiction, particularly
essays on popular science. He has often been praised for the clarity of his
writing but criticised for the lack of sex or aliens in his fiction and for
a shortage of strong female characters in his early work. Join CUSFS to
discuss one of the true legends of science fiction.

<p>SF may have its roots in literature, but it's best known to most
people through TV shows and films.  Why is SF literature still such a
niche genre when media SF is so mainstream?  What do <cite>Stargate</cite>,

and what are the strengths and weaknesses of visual SF?  What's the next
big thing or your favourite show from times past?</p>

<p>In days of old, as the nights drew in, the Jomsvikingar would oftentimes
gather round a blazing fire to tell stories of great bravery and valour.
Each in turn would relate a turning of the tale, and then fall silent and
allow another to take up the threads. In time a wondrous tale would be
spun, and each would retire to sleep with a tear of regret at its ending.</p>

<p>This will be just like that, only with more spaceships (and less fire).
Mince pies and mulled wine will be provided to ease the flow of words. All
welcome--even if you don't feel like joining in, feel free to come and
listen.</p>

<p>To avoid a swift descent into complete chaos, Jomsborg's Bard has provided
the start of the tale, given below to set your imaginations going. There's
only one rule: NO TIME-TRAVEL PLEASE. Beyond that, the Universe is your
oyster...</p>

<hr>
<p>"This is <i>Guiding Light</i>, please respond. <i>Celestial</i>, this is
<i>Guiding Light</i>. Please respond."</p>

<p>Captain Mayhew listened to his own voice loop endlessly out of the
comm as the Imperial Scout Ship <i>Guiding Light</i> pushed on to the last
recorded location of the <i>Celestial</i>.  After days following its wake
they were still unable to raise it.  All Mayhew could do was sit in
his chair and stare at the space in front.</p>

<p>Behind him a door opened and two officers, Finch and Taylor from their
voices, walked onto the bridge.  He craned his neck round to look --
why couldn't they have designed him a swivel chair? -- and saw the
glossy brochure in Finch's hands.  Marketing for the <i>Celestial</i>.</p>

<p>"It's amazing," she wowed. "Ten swimming pools and three adjustable
sub-aqua environments."</p>

<p>"'Adjustable sub-aqua environments'," mocked Taylor. "Still, I'm
looking forward to a rest and a good meal on the <i>Celestial</i>."</p>

<p>Even after a week of silence, nobody believed the problem with the
<i>Celestial</i> was anything but a comms glitch.</p>

<p>There was a beep.  Taylor and Finch looked up.  Captain Mayhew stood.
"You won't have to wait long.  We've got a silhouette, and it's the
<i>Celestial</i>.  You'll be boarding within the hour."</p>

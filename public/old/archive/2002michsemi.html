<p>This is not an official CUSFS event, but CUSFS people are welcome
(several are already going) and we thought you might be interested.</p>

<p>We're going to show season 1 of <cite>Stargate</cite> at Greenend (61 Green End Road)
over the next few weeks on Wednesday evenings starting at <strong>9pm</strong>, watching
four episodes per evening (i.e. finishing at midnight).  If you turn up at <strong>8pm</strong>
then you can also watch the season 6 episode being shown on Sky One.  If you want to catch
everything then don't be late - we won't wait for anyone!</p>

<p>The schedule:</p>

<p>6th November:<br />
    Children of the Gods, The Nox, Bloodlines</p>
    
<p>13th November:<br />
    The Broca Divide, The First Commandment, The Enemy Within, Emancipation</p>
    
<p>20th November:<br />
    Brief Candle, Thor's Hammer, The Torment of Tantalus, Cold Lazarus</p>
    
<p>27th November:<br />
    Fire and Water, Hathor, Singularity, Cor-Ai</p>
    
<p>Break for December</p>

<p>Sometime later (or possibly at a weekend):<br />

<dt id="games"><strong>Semi-detached games evenings</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time and venue:  7.30pm at the Castle Inn for food or
                 9.00pm at Relativity (155 Gilbert Road)</p>
                 
<p>Another unofficial event: a group of CUSFS people often meet in the
Castle (on Castle Hill) on a Thursday evening for food, and then
retire to Relativity for coffee, games and booze.</p>

<p>Typically, games played can include Mao (an intriguing and mysterious card game), 
Albatross (a locally-developed Whist variant with bidding), Pairs Gnostica (a 
strategy game played with tarot cards and small pointy pyramids!) and others.</p>

<p>You'd be welcome to join us.  Note also that the official CUSFS games
evening will be taking place on Sunday 10th November, and a wider variety of 
games will be played there (and bringing your own is encouraged), so if you
only turn up to one games evening please come to the official one!</p>

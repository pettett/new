<h2>Plans for this term</h2>

<p>Sunday 25th Oct - Writing / TTBA workshop</p>

<p>Sunday 1st Nov - Short story discussion. We'll be discussing Asimov's
'Franchise', and Russell's 'And Then There Were None'. The latter can be
found for free <a href="http://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.php">online</a>.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Sunday 8th Nov - Sci fi discussion, topic TBA</p>

<p>Sunday 15th Nov - Novel discussion: The Year Of Our War by Steph Swainston.
If you're a member, the society has copies you can borrow (or you can buy
it, it's 5.99 on amazon - but those of us who've read it have had very
different reactions to it from loving it to finding it really quite
annoying. Caveat emptor.)</p>

<p>Sunday 22 Nov - Talk by Una McCormack. ***Date Now Confirmed*** This
meeting will NOT be at Sidney, but at the Lucia Windsor Room in Newnham,
and we'll have dinner first, so will probably be meeting at 7. Check out
<a href="http://www.unamccormack.com/">her website</a>.</p>

<p>Sunday 29 Nov - Sci fi discussion: topic TBA</p>

<p>Friday 4 Dec - all night board games (probably about 8pm - 4am). Location
TBA.</p>

<p>Sunday 6 Dec - Film evening. Suggestions for films welcome.</p>

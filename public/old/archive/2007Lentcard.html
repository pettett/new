Magic is a key part of fantasy fiction, with spells, rituals,
sacrifices, witches, wizards, priests, faeries, demons, elementals,
magic swords, magic rings, magic wands, spellbooks, schools (and
colleges and universities) of magic all featuring in many works. Who can
work magic, how do they do it, what magic can be worked, and what's the
price of magic - and who pays it? And which magic makes the books and
films that contain it magical themselves, and which magic is
sufficiently unimaginative to be indistinguishable from technology?

<p>Come, celebrate our new year (it's the birthday of Jomsborg the New)
with us, playing games, talking, drinking mead... all night (or you can
leave after a bit if you get tired, possibly to join us again for dawn).</p>

<p>The Reeve of Jomsborg has a very important duty to perform - the sun
must come up, else the world shall be plunged into icy darkness! After
sunrise (sunrise is scheduled for 7:35am, but we'll need to be there
earlier), we'll go into town to find some breakfast.</p>

<p>Note that there will be no regular CUSFS meeting that Sunday, as we will
all be very tired.</p>

<tr>
  <td colspan="3">
Science fiction has two main awards - the Hugo and the Nebula, and there
are many other awards too - many magazines and societies make their own
awards (including the hallowed CUSFS Hall Of Fame), and SF can also win
mainstream awards such as the Oscars. But does winning an award mean
that a work is any good - or if you're a cynic, does it always mean that
it's a work to avoid?! Come and discuss which awards get it right and
which get it wrong, which works have been showered with awards despite
being very bad and which ones have been cruely neglected.

Biology! The Science of the ancient mysteries! The Science that aims to explain
LIFE itself! We have seen the Triffids raise their hideous stings above the
streets of London, we have heard the Andromeda Strain almost laying waste to
humanity, and Greg Bear's Blood Music has destroyed civilisation as we know it.
Reality, as usual, is slow in living up to the promise of fiction. Why is
this, and is it truly a bad thing?</td>

  <td colspan="3">
In days of yore, CUSFS would meet in someone's room once a week, there
to eat and converse pleasantly. We haven't done this recently, but now seems
an excellent time to start. We shall have food, good company, and of
course the ghost of Kelvin hovering over the revels.

In the event of an alien attack, what would YOU do? Death and misery
lie all around you, the White House and Big Ben have both been blown to
Technicolour smithereens! Bullets are ineffective against the new overlords, be
they Martians, Tripods, Vegans, or even a Black Cloud. If you don't want to
be part fo the screaming masses, come to CUSFS and learn the secret ways of
the saviours of Earth!

  <td colspan="3">
Science Fiction is sometimes good, often bad and occasionally Really
Bad. In
the latter case, it is so bad it is utterly awesome. Bring your
favourite
misplaced adjectives to biblioclastic CUSFS, stride in a sea of mixed
metaphors
and marvel at the wonders of bad plotting!

If you are lucky, we might even dig out the Eye of Argon for you.

  <th>Games Evening</th>
  <td>Burrell's Field Common Room, Trinity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">
The best way to finish the term; come and play games old, new, silly
and
sensible with CUSFS! If you have any games you would like to play,
bring them!
The games get sillier as the evening wears on, and this is the ideal
way to
finish the term, and a good preparation for a long train journey home.

Warning: RoboRally will occur! If you have not previously heard of
this
game, prepare for the experience of a lifetime.

  <th>Sunday 22 January</th>
  <th>Discussion: Fantasy on Film</th>
  <td>New Hall, Video Room</td>

<tr>
  <td colspan="3">
Recent years have seen many fantasy works, old and new, adapted as films
- <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite>, <cite>Harry Potter</cite> and
<cite>Narnia</cite> as the most obvious examples. What did you like or
dislike about the film versions as compared to the books? What aspects of
a book lead to a good or bad film? How do the new films match up to older
works, such as <cite>The Princess Bride</cite> and <cite>Labyrinth</cite>?
How has the flood of big-budget fantasy films influenced public perception
of the genre? Which actors / actresses were hottest?!<br />

Come along and talk about any or all of these questions, and anything else you fancy.

  <td colspan="3">
And so another year of Jómsborg the New ends. Join the Reeve, Companions
and other Jómsvikingar in our preparations for the New Year. The Jómsvikingar
purify themselves by staying up throughout the night, helped along by
games, readings, mead, conversation, and anything else that comes to mind.
Oh, and probably a fair amount of coffee. Distractions will include being
able to actually look at the CUSFS library sale books (so bring money if you
might be interested in buying any).<br />
The particularly devout meet on top of Castle Mound at sunset to bid farewell
to the Old Sun, which is due to finally wind down at 16:44 on the 28th.

The host of the Jómsvikingar march, as one, to the hub of the Universe
(known simply to mortal folk as the Castle Mound). There, the Reeve,
assisted by the assembled throng and a large quantity of mead, raises the
New Sun, gives it form, and sets it circling for another year. The
ceremony will start at about <strong>07:30</strong>; sunrise is scheduled for 07:43.<br />
We will try to organise breakfast for those interested (and still awake!)
after the Afm&aelig;lisdagr. Even if you do not manage to attend the Wake please
feel free to join us on Castle Mound!

New SF authors are often lauded as the "great white hope of hard SF". But what is hardness
in SF, why might we want it, and how often do authors live up to the description?

  <td colspan="3">
The perfect antidote to Fourth Week Blues. Bring a game, or come and play
someone else's. Games old, new and very very silly will be played.
There will also be a chance to look through the library sale books. We have
several hundred spare SF and fantasy books for sale, so come prepared to grab
yourself a bargain or three...<br />

In addition to the games evening and AGM, election of new committee members
will be taking place. The committee posts are Chairbeing, Secretary, Treasurer,
Membership Secretary, Librarian and TTBA Editor, so if you think you might be
interested, contact the committee for more information, or to talk to the
individual current officer. Some details of the committee posts are also
in the constitution.

Picocon is a one-day SF convention, run by ICSF, the Imperial College

venerable SF author and spinner of long tales, horror writer Natasha
Mostert, and Mark Roberts, co-editor of <cite>The Thackery T. Lambshead
Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases</cite>. Come along to hear
their stories, and to browse second-hand book stalls, play games, destroy
dodgy SF merchandise (with liquid nitrogen if you're lucky!) and support
CUSFS' reigning fish-duelling champion.<br />

Entrance costs &pound;6 for students and &pound;8 for non-students;
there will be a CUSFS party going from Cambridge station on the 9:15
to King's Cross (look out for the orange scarves).<br />

Introduce us to someone new, or convert us to an old favourite. Alternatively,
come to listen to what others have brought to read, and be enlightened, amused,
horrified, or just confused.

  <th>Sunday 5 March, 8pm</th>
  <th>Discussion: "Where have all the empires gone?"</th>
  <td>Pembroke, Foundress Court, room AA24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">
SF used to be full of interstellar empires - for many years a galactic
empire was the 'usual' form of government portrayed in seminal works
like Asimov's <cite>Foundation</cite> and by many other authors including
Pournelle, Heinlein, and Niven. Since then authors of spacefaring SF
like Vernor Vinge, Alastair Reynolds, Lois McMaster Bujold, and Ken McLeod
seem gradually to be moving to describing a less connected, more
messy, world - although some of the societies described by modern SF
are arguably quite imperial (consider Iain M. Banks's Culture).<br />

Why have empires gone out of fashion? Indeed, have they? What did
we like about them - are they just good fun, or is there something
deeper to the attraction?

  <th>Storytelling</th>
  <td>155 Gilbert Road</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">
<p>In days of old, as the nights drew in, the J&oacute;msvikingar would oftentimes
gather round a blazing fire to tell stories of great bravery and valour.
Each in turn would relate a turning of the tale, and then fall silent and
allow another to take up the threads. In time a wondrous tale would be spun,
and each would retire to sleep with a tear of regret at its ending.<br />

This will be just like that, only with more spaceships (and less fire).
All welcome - even if you don't feel like joining in, feel free to come
and listen.<br />

To avoid a swift descent into complete chaos, our Bard has provided the
start of the tale, given below to set your imaginations going. There's
only one rule: NO TIME-TRAVEL PLEASE. Beyond that, the Universe is your
oyster...</p>

<hr />
<p>"This is Guiding Light, please respond. <i>Celestial</i>, this is <i>Guiding Light</i>.
Please respond."</p>

<p>Captain Mayhew listened to his own voice loop endlessly out of the comm
as the Imperial Scout Ship <i>Guiding Light</i> pushed on to the last recorded
location of the <i>Celestial</i>. After days following its wake they were still
unable to raise it. All Mayhew could do was sit in his chair and stare at
the space in front.</p>

<p>Behind him a door opened and two officers, Finch and Taylor from their
voices, walked onto the bridge. He craned his neck round to look - why
couldn't they have designed him a swivel chair? - and saw the glossy
brochure in Finch's hands. Marketing for the <i>Celestial</i>.</p>

<p>"It's amazing," she wowed. "Ten swimming pools and three adjustable
sub-aqua environments."</p>

<p>"'Adjustable sub-aqua environments'," mocked Taylor. "Still, I'm looking
forward to a rest and a good meal on the <i>Celestial</i>."</p>

<p>Even after a week of silence, nobody believed the problem with the
<i>Celestial</i> was anything but a comms glitch.</p>

<p>There was a beep. Taylor and Finch looked up. Captain Mayhew stood. "You
won't have to wait long. We've got a silhouette, and it's the <i>Celestial</i>.
You'll be boarding within the hour."</p>

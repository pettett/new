<p>The Veizla is the annual dinner of Jómsborg the New, and also marks the
inauguration of a new Reeve and Companions. There will be a mead reception
with puzzles and the annual Jómsphoto, followed by dinner (during which
people will be asked to answer the Reeve's Challenge - see below), followed
by port and more mead, and the traditional announcement of the new Reeve and
Companions. Afterwards we are likely to retire for further merriment.</p>

<p>Booking for the Veizla has now closed. Everyone who booked should have
received an e-mail confirmation from the Reeve; if you haven't, or if
you need reminding of details or have any other questions, e-mail
the Reeve using <b>soc-cusfs at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk.</b></p>

<p>There will be a mead reception starting at 7pm in the Open Walkway;
follow the main corridor from the Porters' Lodge until you reach the
open air. There will be puzzles to solve and a group photograph. The
meal will begin at 8pm, in the Council Room.</p>

<p>The menu will be as follows:</p>

<p align="center">
Deep fried rosemary-scented brie with a cranberry and lime salsa<br /><br />

Roasted haunch of venison with redcurrant and sage<br />

or<br />

Mushroom and garlic strudel with a cream and chive sauce<br /><br />

Chocolate and cointreau torte<br />

Coffee<br />

Port and mead
</p>

<p>The dress code is black tie or fancy dress. Please bring a pen and your
Jómsscarf (if you have one).</p>

<p>Prices are: drinking &pound;35 members (&pound;38 non-members);
non-drinking &pound;27 members (&pound;30 non-members).</p>

<p>During the course of the meal, you will be asked to answer the
Reeve's Challenge, which this year is:</p>

<p><u>Excuses</u><br />
Back in the mists of time, when the Reeve was but knee-high to
an authentic Danish wolf-cub, the J&oacute;msvikingar would oftentimes
meet of a lunchtime to partake of bread and cheese and like
nourishment. Between the food and the washing-up, however,
disaster often befell the company, and their host would return
to find a missive explaining at length their trials and
adventures, and the reasons for not vanquishing the washing-up.<br />

The washing-up, of course, would have been completed by some
shadowy, ill-understood agency.<br />

Please answer the Challenge with an inventive excuse, or,
alternatively, explain why you've failed to answer the Challenge...

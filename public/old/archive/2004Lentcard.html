you.  If you have any stories, reviews, comments, letters, drawings -- in
fact, anything related to science fiction or fantasy -- we want them!
Why not review the books you read over the Christmas break?  Send your
contributions to <a href="mailto:soc-cusfs-ttba@lists.cam.ac.uk">soc-cusfs-ttba@lists.cam.ac.uk</a> by Friday 23rd January.

themselves by staying up throughout the night, helped along by games, 
readings, mead, conversation, and anything else that comes to mind. Oh, and probably 
a fair amount of coffee. The particularly devout meet on top of Castle Mound at
sunset to bid farewell to the Old Sun, which is due to finally wind down at 16:41 on
the 30th. Distractions will include a new issue of <a href="../ttba/index.html"><i>TTBA</i></a>,

bring money if you might be interested in buying any), and...

<a href = "http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/scc/icsf/social/events/picocon_21.html">Picocon</a>
is a one-day SF convention, run by ICSF, the Imperial College SF and fantasy society. 
The guests of honour this year are <a href="http://mabu.homeip.net/PeterFHamilton/index.html">Peter F Hamilton</a>,
<a href="http://www.omegacom.demon.co.uk/index.htm">Paul McAuley</a> and
<a href="http://www.adamroberts.com/">Adam Roberts</a> - each of them has a slot in the
programme where they will talk about something that interests them, and take questions
from the audience.<br />
There will also be a dealers' room, with second-hand booksellers etc., and various events
throughout the day (past Picocons have included dalek racing, quizzes, a LAN games room,
juggling lessons and `destruction of dodgy merchandise' auctions, among other things).
The programme starts at 11am and concludes at 8pm with a showing of
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0338337/">Paycheck</a>. <br />
Entrance costs &pound;5.00 for students (with ID!) and &pound;7.00 for others. A CUSFS group
will be going to Picocon, by train, travelling on the 09:01 to King's Cross. If you're
interested, please join us at the railway station (look for the orange scarves) by 8:45am
- this should allow enough time for buying tickets. (The recommended ticket is the One-Day
Travelcard (about &pound;16), which includes a day return to London and unlimited travel
on the Underground. Discounts are available with Young Person's and Network Railcards.) If
you have lectures on Saturday morning and can't meet us at Cambridge station, do consider
coming along later for the afternoon events - it's usually a very enjoyable day.

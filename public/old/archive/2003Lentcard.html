Joint trip with the <a href="http://tolkien.soc.ucam.org/">Cambridge Tolkien Society</a>
to see the latest Lord of the Rings film (the middle of the trilogy). It is
strongly recommended that you book your ticket beforehand - this can be done
online at the Warner website. We will meet in the area just inside the cinema,
where the ticket collection posts and food counters are, at 7:00pm. Comparable
to Tolkien at his best.

  <td colspan="5">
Virtual Worlds are everywhere in SF.  From <cite>Tron</cite> to <cite>The Matrix</cite>,
<cite>Permutation City</cite> to cyberspace and the metaverse, SF has a lasting
fascination with worlds which exist only inside a computer.  What do
these worlds tell us about ourselves and our relationship with the
real world we live in?  What is the real world anyway?  And with
science bringing true Virtual Reality closer, should we be afraid that
so many SF virtual worlds are dystopias?

Marion Zimmer Bradley is best known for her Darkover fantasy and

matrix magic/technology believable?  Are the books best before the
Terrannan turn up?  Also, find out about some of MZB's more obscure
works...

And so another year of J&oacute;msborg the New ends. Join the Reeve, Companions and
J&oacute;msvikingar in our preparation for the New Year. The J&oacute;msvikingar purify
themselves by staying up throughout the night, helped along by a selection of games, 
reading, sparkling conversation, and anything else that comes to mind. Oh, and probably 
a fair amount of coffee. The particularly devout meet on top of Castle Mound at
sunset to bid farewell to the Old Sun, which is due to finally wind down at 16:46 on 
the 1st. Distractions will include...

The Quest is one of the central themes of fantasy writing. Has it been over-used, or is

good or bad, and to speculate on what's <em>really</em> at the end of the rainbow...

<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
The host of the J&oacute;msvikingar march, as one, to the hub of the Universe (known 
simply to mortal folk as the Castle Mound). There, the Reeve, assisted by the assembled 
throng and a large quantity of mead, raises the New Sun, gives it form, and sets it 
circling for another year. We will try to organise breakfast for those interested 
(and still awake!) after the Afmaelisdagr. <br>
NB. As all true J&oacute;msvikingar know, the Afmaelisdagr falls on 31 January, the 
first day of J&oacute;msborg's year. And so it will this year too. For complex and 
arcane reasons, the relevant period has fallen out of the normal temporal sequence 
this year. Please complain to your calendar manufacturer.

<a href="http://union.ic.ac.uk/scc/icsf/social/events/picocon.html">Picocon</a> is a 
one-day SF convention, run by ICSF, the Imperial College SF and fantasy 
society. The guests of honour this year are Gwyneth Jones and Dr Jack Cohen - each of 
them has a slot in the programme where they will talk about something that interests 
them, and take questions from the audience. There will also be a dealers' room, with 
second-hand booksellers etc., and various events throughout the day (past Picocons have
included dalek racing, quizzes, a LAN games room, juggling lessons and "destruction of
dodgy merchandise" auctions, among other things). The programme (now up on the
<a href="http://union.ic.ac.uk/scc/icsf/social/events/picocon.html">Picocon website</a>)
starts at 10:15am and concludes with a showing of Twelve Monkeys at 5pm.<br /> 
Entrance costs &pound;5.00 for students (with ID!) and &pound;8.00 for others. A CUSFS group 
will be going to Picocon, by train, travelling on the 08:45 to King's Cross. If you're 
interested, please join us at the railway station (look for the orange scarves) by 8:30am - 
this should allow enough time for buying tickets. (The recommended ticket is the One-Day 
Travelcard (about &pound;15), which includes a day return to London and unlimited travel on 
the Underground. Discounts are available with Young Person's and Network Railcards.) If
you have lectures on Saturday morning and can't meet us at Cambridge station, do consider 
coming along later for the afternoon events - it's usually a very enjoyable day.

publishing intelligent hard SF since the mid-1960s. Today he is both a
very active writer (and one of the few SF authors around who can tackle
genetics convincingly) and an SF historian, having (among other things)
contributed heavily to the <cite>Encyclopedia of SF</cite>. Come along to eulogise,

  <td colspan="5">
Walter Jon Williams does it all. His <i>Metropolitan</i> gives us a future
city where magic is generated, harnessed, and billed to the customer.
<i>Aristoi</i> explores virtual realities and multiple personalities, <i>Knight
Moves</i> follows the search for FTL communication and travel between
scattered human colonies, and his <i>Dread Empire's Fall</i> space opera
trilogy asks what happens when a totalitarian regime comes to an end.
Join us to discuss his work.

Join us for our annual foray into cocktail invention. For a small fee

ingredients for your mad schemes. Previous concoctions can be found in the
<a href="../drinks.html">CUSFS drinks list</a>.<br />

Please email by 6pm Sunday 25th April if you intend to come so we can judge

  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <th>Discussion: Religion in fantasy and SF</th>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>155 Gilbert Road</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Many authors introduce religion into their work. Sometimes it seems
that it's a commentary on real-world religions; sometimes the religion
stands for something else - and sometimes it's just there to add local
colour or help unstick the plot. Is this done well? Does it help
the story? In some cases we actually get to see god(s) as characters
in the story - do we like it?<br />
Come and talk about religion, faith and the like at our discussion.
(We promise not to talk about the truth or otherwise of any real
religions!)

<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Bring along a short piece of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature (either a (very!)
short story, or an extract from something longer - no more than 4 or 5 pages is a
good rule of thumb) to scare, impress, or entertain the company. Introduce us to
someone new, or convert us to an old favourite. Alternatively, come to listen to what
others have brought to read, and be enlightened, amused, horrified, or just confused.

  <th>Sunday 9 May</th>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <th>Discussion: Mary Gentle</th>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>6 Ainsworth Court</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Mary Gentle is not the most prolific of authors, but what she may lack in
quantity, she more than makes up in quality. Her SF and fantasy are
thought-provoking and inventive in setting and characters: her invented
worlds include "the city at the heart of the world", ruled by giant rats and
a cabal of gods, an alternate Civil War England with Queen Carola and Olivia
the Protector, and a medieval Europe where Mithraism never died out, and
Carthage survives "under the Penitence". The characters who inhabit these
worlds are distinctively drawn, and very human in their imperfections; we
clearly see them change and grow as their stories proceed. Interestingly,
for an author who does not explicitly espouse feminism, most of Gentle's
protagonists are women. To quote the Encyclopedia of Fantasy, Mary Gentle
"is a writer of violence; her style is muscular and thrusting; her
conclusions tend to be dangerous; and her stories are never comfortable."<br />

Intrigued? Want to know more, to agree or disagree? Come along, ask
questions, and maybe find some answers about this fascinating author.

  <th>Sunday 16 May</th>

  <th>Discussion: <cite>Buffy</cite>, <cite>Angel</cite> and <cite>Firefly</cite>: the Whedonverse</th>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>11 Atherton Close</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="5">
Joss Whedon had it all, just over a year ago: <cite>Buffy</cite> was in its final
season, <cite>Angel</cite> was going strong in its fourth, and he had his
western-in-space, <cite>Firefly</cite>, making its debut onto American screens. And now
all three have left the small screen.<br />

Come and indulge in the memories of the glorious Whedon-era this Sunday.
Just what was it about <cite>Buffy</cite> that caused so much passion in fans and
critics alike? How did it evolve over its 7 years? How has <cite>Angel</cite> staked
(so sorry...) out its own turf? What do we want to see in the upcoming
<cite>Firefly</cite> film, <cite>Serenity</cite>? And finally, and most importantly for our
sanity, what can we watch now?<br />

During the course of the evening we will show an episode of <cite>Buffy</cite>. Wish us
monsters.

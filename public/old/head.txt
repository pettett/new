<h1>The CUSFS Library Catalogue</h1>

<p>This is the catalogue of the library of the CU Science Fiction Society. At present we have
a little over 5000 books. Borrowing is free but limited to CUSFS members.
See the <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cusfs/member.html">membership page</a> for details of how to join.</p>
<p>In addition, we have a large quantity of SF magazines from various eras (currently catalogued only on a card database; I will be happy to check the existence of a particular item, or show the catalogue to members). Thanks to a recent donation, we have a large back collection of Interzone magazine, which is currently uncatalogued.</p> 

<p> If there's something here you want
to borrow, simply email the Librarian at
<b>soc-cusfs-library at lists dot cam dot ac dot uk</b>
to arrange a time to collect it. Please cut-and-paste the relevant catalogue
lines into your mail if you can (including all the numbers etc.) as this helps
with fetching the books. The best way to borrow or return library books is at discussions/events *with advance warning*.

</p><p> Books marked 'out' are currently on loan; books marked 'X' are being
repaired. These can be borrowed eventually but may take a while to become
available. Please ask if you're interested in something as this will probably
accelerate the process!

</p><p>See also <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cusfs/cat-new.html">What's New?</a>

</p><p>There is also a mostly-complete list of our infinite <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cusfs/cat-startrek.html">Star Trek collection</a>
by number rather than author.

</p><p>Key to letters:<br>
A = anthology - D = double - N = non-fiction<br>
X = temporarily withdrawn for repair<br>
J = Originally donated to J&oacute;msborg</p>

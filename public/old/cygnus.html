<h1>The CUSFS-Cygnus Book Project</h1>

<p>At the beginning of 2008, Thomas Goodey, founder member of CUSFS from the dim and distant past, contacted the society with a proposal...</p>

<p>It transpired that Thomas was working in Suceava, in northern Romania on a project at the Planetarium of Stefan del Mare University. The Planetarium has a science society - <a href="http://www.cygnus.ro/">Cygnus</a> - with a science fiction wing, and although they had a fine room to use as a library, they were lacking SF books in to put in it. Fortuitously, CUSFS had several hundred duplicate books that weren't going anywhere, and so a plan was hatched to solve both problems at once.</p>

<p>In the end, CUSFS passed along nearly 300 books, along with another 130 donated by former member Mike Hardy. The complete list of titles can be seen <a href="cygnus.txt">here</a>.</p>

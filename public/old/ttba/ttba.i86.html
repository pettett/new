<hr><a name="editoria"><h2>Editorial: Typing "Traish, Barry"
Again</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Welcome to a new issue, a new committee, a new editor and a new
incarnation for <cite>ttba</cite>.  I have to say I'm quite surprised
at the paucity of tortoises and turtles in previous <cite>ttba</cite>s
- but it looks as though their time has come (no doubt the memetic
influence of <cite>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</cite>).  I'm also
surprised that no&#173;one has ever tried to change the title of this
magazine to something sensible.  Perhaps some future editor more
courageous than myself?<p>

In fact, I'm surprised at quite a lot of things: for one, the quite
incredible tenacity of this magazine.  Over seventeen years, a
comparable number of editors have struggled, and succeeded in bringing
out (as the constitution demands) at least one issue every term.  Lack
of contributions did not deter them (volume 12 number 1, <cite>The
Torment Begins Again</cite>, appears to have been written entirely by
the two editors in the space of 24 hours).  Nor did snow, sleet, hail,
inadequate technology or piles of contributions from Huw Walters (or
his early incarnation as Huw Walker, c. 1973).<p>

So what causes this remarkable dedication?  And what function (if any)
does <cite>ttba</cite> serve in our society (and in society at large)?
I like to think of it as serving three purposes.<p>

First, as a medium for publication of fiction.  It would be untrue to
claim that <cite>ttba</cite> provides a springboard for student
writers to get into sf (although Nick Lowe and Alison Spedding have
certainly gone on to better things), but I think there is a certain
satisfaction and encouragement in seeing your creative output in
print, and in having it commented on (if only over a drink in New Hall
bar).  There is talent out there, if only it can be persuaded to put
pen to paper or finger to keyboard, and some of the fiction in
<cite>ttba</cite> (although admittedly a small proportion) has been of
a remarkably high standard.<p>

Secondly, as a forum for critical discussion.  Criticism is one thing
sf lacks, and magazines like <cite>Vector</cite>, <cite>Australian SF
Review</cite> and <cite>Interzone</cite> can only begin to fill the
gap.  Good works are being published, but how can they be separated
from the vast quantity of rubbish we know by Sturgeon's law they are
buried under (Dan Simmons, Connie Willis, Kim Newman, Robert Charles
Wilson - have you heard of them?  Are they good?).  I could rant about
the coverage of sf in the national press - the <cite>Guardian</cite>
occasionally devotes six or so column inches to cover a month's sf
publications - but I won't.  Critical essays in amateur publications
like <cite>ttba</cite> inevitably tend to be along the lines of "here
are some good books by my favourite author" but even this is
worthwhile, and when a well&#173;thought&#173;out article arrives, the
editor can only boggle and give it pride of place in that term's
issue.<p>

Thirdly, as a record of the society.  Forget literature and criticism,
you say, this is where <cite>ttba</cite> comes into its own.  Or does
it?  OK, you get a list of committee members and discussions, but not
much more than that.  A couple of years ago, the then editor (Julian
Todd) wrote of the upcoming speaker meeting to be given by John
Brunner,

<blockquote>"...there will be thousands and thousands of CUSFS members
who would have liked to attend this speaker meeting, but can't.
Because they are not yet members.  And won't be for another ten to
twenty years...  someone is going to remember the good bits and write
something about them..."</blockquote>

Unfortunately no&#173;one did, but the sentiment was there.<p>

But all this is a bit beside the point.  I think the real reason
behind the longevity of <cite>ttba</cite> is that sf fans like
ourselves love the printed word.  We build up vast collections of
books, comics and magazines, caring less whether they are good or bad
than if they have some connection with science fiction.<p>

Enough ranting for one issue, I think.<p>



<hr><a name="chairman"><h2>The Chairman's Address</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

I stepped from the ship and, turning my head, surveyed them.  One
hundred survivors.  One hundred who chose to flee.  The last one
hundred.<p>

We had been taken completely by surprise; never stood a chance.  Those
that we had left behind were nothing - mindless automatons under a
control not their own.  But there had been one ship, one last hope for
humanity and somehow we had managed to escape.  In fleeing to this far
flung corner there was a chance that we could rebuild something of
that which we had lost, perhaps even one day go back and reclaim what
belonged to us. How long?<p>

I shielded my eyes from the light of an alien sun, so that I could
study the remnant more closely.  They were wretches.  Their clothing
was ragged, their feet unclad, their eyes unhopeful, bitter
reflections of their souls.  But still they looked up - a hundred
pairs of eyes rested on me.  Me.  I swam in the power and drowned in
the responsibility.  The crew was dead and I had been the one to
emerge from the control room.  They all looked to me to save them, to
lead them back.  These poor creatures weren't the soldiers I needed to
return, but somewhere their pride still burned strong, I knew, and I
would shape them.<p>

One year later.<p>

I strolled within my encampment.  A young lieutenant saw me and
saluted sharply.  Ha!  The power felt good.  In only a year I had
turned the misbegotten waifs into an invincible fighting unit, with
which I good defeat all our enemies.  Any other man would have
produced farmers or traders, but armed with the space axes of old
jokes and cliche dealing Flaz&#173;Gaz heat rays, I would conquer!<p>

Time to depart, back home.  I wanted one last look at the graves of
the old crew, now all memories, almost forgotten.<p>

The captain, `Hang Dog' Walkers.  Only half human, a cross between
earth and the planet Wails.  He went mad eventually, withdrawing
within himself, which he thought was the whole universe, in his
megalomania.  I saluted him and moved on.<p>

The navigator, `Slide Rule' Spindly.  His mathematical skills were
unswerving; he had computed the course of the ship before it
crashed.<p>

The second officer, Jacaranda Mellow.  Her grave was undug, we never
found her body in the wreck.<p>

The ship's computer, CCA10.  So intelligent it was almost human, we
had buried its CPU here.<p>

The communication's officer, Triskele Murrone.  her final words were
our Mayday.  "Raffle... does anyone out there want some..."<p>

The records officer, Gimon Arrowroot.  He had recorded every event,
but only an embarrassing photo of himself remained.<p>

I turned, nothing could stop me now.<p>



<hr><a name="exeditor"><h2>Time To Back Away</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Arrowsmith</h3>

So this is it.  <cite>ttba</cite> is no longer in my hands.  It feels
a little strange to be writing this, not having any control over where
its going.  Not that I did when I was editing, really.  The only
reason for the existence of this bibble is that I ran out of space in
"Still Mists In August".  This is to properly thank all those who have
helped and hindered me through my not&#173;quite&#173;a-year in
office, including the CUSU photocopier, and to express my regrets at
not having made any puns about the fourthcoming <cite>ttba</cite>
having come forth (and, indeed, fourth).<p>

All my burdens are now laid upon Gareth.  This includes the Editor's
Box, which I had to disturb from the dark corner of my overhead
cupboard it was lurking in and carry down to Christ's (Christs' - now
there's an interesting concept...).  It was clearly not pleased by
something, either this disturbance to its sedentary existance or the
subsequent gutting inflicted on it by my rash successor, for the next
day I was struck low by a very suspicious disease.  All this goes to
show something.  I'm not sure what, though.<p>

That about winds it up, I suppose.  A certain nasty set of things
lurks on my horizon (although they will be past by the time this is
read) and I really should be working or sleeping or making some more
job applications.  Anyone got a temporary vacancy for a sometime
chemist about to mutate into a mineralogist and
ex&#173;<cite>ttba</cite> editor?<p>



<hr><a name="phoebedr"><h2>Phoebe, Dreaming</h2></a>

<h3>Michael Abbott</h3>

At the centre of the kingdom, there is a cubical room, containing a
large bed.  It is covered with a green satin quilt, and behind it are
two columns, one black and one white.  In the bed lies Phoebe.  She is
breathing evenly, her silver hair spread over the pillows, her hands
on the cover.  She is asleep, and she is dreaming.<p>

She dreams of people.  She dreams of a hunched figure standing by a
doorway, and the light in the room fades as the figure appears.
Phoebe is in another bed, and when she moves a hand towards the
figure, it is the pudgy hand of a baby, yet all of Phoebe is there,
already complete in the child.  The figure wears a ragged black robe
and hood, and carries a gnarled stick.  Its face cannot be seen.<p>

Phoebe dreams of her father: Aurelius, golden&#173;haired, powerful
and noble.  First he leans forward in his seat to see the figure in
the sudden gloom, and then he pales at the sight and stands up.
Phoebe, dreaming, knows her as the Crone, a bringer of disasters and a
warning of doom to the kingdom.  The Crone speaks, and her voice is
harsh and dry.  When she finishes, the sun comes from behind a cloud,
striking the doorway directly: but all it shows are specks of dust
whirling in the passage.<p>

The baby Phoebe stares silently at all these things, and afterwards
some whisper that it was strange that she did not cry at all.<p>

<br>

Phoebe stirs slightly, and dreams of a man that she knows but has
never met.  She dreams of him as a youth in a dusty land: a swift,
handsome prince, strong and clever.  The sun shines off his fair hair
as he fences on the sand with the other boys his age.  But he
outfences them all, as he has done before, and he turns away, bored
and dissatisfied.  He looks around for something new to do.  His name
is Alexander.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams of her childhood: of a five&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe,
dressed formally in a scaled&#173;down court&#173;lady's gown of
midnight blue.  She walks down a gloomy corridor, her skirts lifted
carefully above the dusty floor.  Her face solemn, she seems not to
ignore, but to be genuinely unaware of, the bows and curtsies of those
she passes.  But the dreaming Phoebe sees them all, and also the
scowls and the whispers, and the signs some make to ward off evil.<p>

Princess Phoebe is not as popular as most beautiful young princesses,
for she brings much more with her than most.<p>

<br>

Phoebe's dream shifts to her father.  As the child Phoebe walks down
the corridor, he is riding the edges of the kingdom, overseeing the
planting of thorn bushes.  He travels well&#173;guarded, but not armed
himself, for he understands how to speak with his people.  In most
places he visits, he has to comfort them: reassure by his presence,
explain with his words, calm and show them that their king knows his
duties and cares for his subjects.<p>

He is a good king: to the serfs he is gentle and understanding, to his
soldiers he is honest and strong.  Only his sleeping daughter, looking
back into the past, sees his vulnerability: the tiredness in his face
after giving a village strength, or the uncertainty in his eyes as he
turns from reassuring a young woman with a daughter Phoebe's age.<p>

<br>

At five years old, Alexander will already speak six languages well.
Phoebe at five speaks only one, and that quietly and rarely.  She
visits her mother in her private chambers, and as soon as the door is
shut runs into her mother's arms and is hugged.  Phoebe is close to
no&#173;one else in the court, but she knows her mother well, and the
smile on Phoebe's face would surprise the court, who have never seen
her either smile or cry.  Phoebe and her mother are very alike in some
ways, and Queen Selene is teaching Phoebe he skills and wisdom.
Phoebe speaks only one language, but she speaks it well, and she is
learning to speak it so that the trees will understand.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams of the future.  She is a grown woman, still
silver&#173;haired, still grave and elegant, and now she is loved by
her people for the king she has brought them.  The new king, like
Phoebe's father, is golden&#173;haired.  He rules well but casually:
the court and commoners can forgive him this, though, for it is
obvious how much he and Phoebe love one another.  She has already
borne him one daughter, and each one fills the other's world, and give
the other purpose.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams of the past, and dreams again of her christening.  The
day is fine, and the ceremonies have been going well.  Dukes have
presented fine gems and jewellery, courtiers paintings, and guild
leaders the finest work of their master craftsmen.  The court poets
read fine verses granting her all the virtues suitable to a royal
princess, and the astrologers have predicted a long life, and a fine
prince who will love her greatly.  Once again Phoebe sees the sun
hidden by a cloud as the Crone appears in a doorway; she feels the
temperature drop, and hears the sudden silence.  She sees how
no&#173;one flees, or screams, or threatens the Crone, such is her
power to command attention.  the Crone speaks, and all listen.  She
brings her own christening gift for the infant princess: that on her
sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger, and fall asleep for a
hundred years, till a prince will come to wake her with a kiss.  That
she will be lost to her parents, and forfeited by the court to one
greater in power than them all.<p>

Phoebe, dreaming, sees the court reacting to the Crone's words.  Some
show fear and some show shock; some show relief that her curse is
aimed only at the princess, some sorrow that she will have to bear the
burden alone.  Aurelius, straining to see in the sudden dimness, is
grim, but only Selene shows quiet resignation, coupled with
determination.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams of Alexander, aged sixteen, and his birthday goes very
differently from hers.  In the morning, he disputes with philosophers,
but only to while away the time, for their sophistries are easily
answered, or too absurd to be worth a reply.  But in the afternoon,
boredom is put aside, for a while at least: his father presents him
with his first command, a hundred cavalrymen (but he is the best rider
among them), for him to train and order as he will.  He will even be
able to lead them on patrol at the edges of the desert kingdom.  He
smiles slightly in anticipation, at something new happening in his
life, and maybe the beginning of his fame.<p>

Phoebe, lying on her thick comfortable mattress, does not smile, but
stirs uneasily in her sleep.  She dreams of something else.<p>

<br>

She dreams of the present, of the kingdom around her.  Throughout the
land, everything is still.  All the people of the palace, all the
peasants, in their fields or in their huts, all the merchants at their
counting&#173;boards or stalls, lie in deep slumber.  Some of the more
careful or fortunate lie in beds.  The animals also lie asleep, in
setts, on branches or in meadows.  The trees still have the blossoms
of early summer, the flowers still nod in the breeze.  The corn is
still half&#173;ripe, the bread made by bakers the morning they fell
asleep is still fresh, and, alas, the wine in the palace cellars has
not matured since the day, eighty years ago, that the Crone's geas and
the Queen's fertility magic took combined effect. Phoebe's sight, in
her mind, passes over the whole of the kingdom: the only noise comes
from the wind rustling through leaves, and the rivers (in which the
fish no longer swim) running over stones.  all in the kingdom are
asleep, lying still as death: and of them all, only Phoebe dreams.<p>

<br>

Phoebe's vision of the kingdom passes outward, spiralling from the
castle at the centre towards the edges.  There, at last, she finds
something awake: the thorn trees.  They stand around the edge of the
kingdom, guarding it, and though they are trees, they are more than
just wood, and they guard the kingdom well.  Though they were planted
under the supervision of King Aurelius, it was the magic laid in them
by Queen Selene that made them grow and kept them strong: and Queen
Selene had had her daughter's help to make the magic.  Watchful in
their fashion, they are aware of Phoebe's attention upon them, and
accept her, as they would accept only two others.<p>

Phoebe's head moves slightly on the pillow, and her vision passes over
the thorn trees to the valleys beyond.  There, gazing at the
impenetrable thickets, is a man, in early middle age, with the
weatherbeaten strength of the traveller, and with a harp slung over
his back.  He looks faintly familiar to Phoebe's sight.  At present he
is probing the thorn hedge carefully with a stick: but it resists
completely, and he gives up his efforts with a smile.  Phoebe watches
him walk off down the hill: she has already dreamed of where he will
go now, and she has dreamt of his meetings with other bards, and of
the tales that they tell.<p>

<br>

Phoebe remembers another player, and dreams of her tenth birthday.  At
ten, she has learned much from Selene, and on her birthday morning she
is taken aside by Aurelius, who has decided that she is old enough to
learn the truth.  He tells her of the curse of the Crone, and the
moderation that Phoebe's mother had been able to put on it, so that
Phoebe would not lose her would, and would not travel alone into the
future.  Phoebe listened gravely, asking questions occasionally.  She
has heard much of it from Selene, and more in whispers around the
court: but she is interested to note how different it sounds from him
than it did from Selene: she told the unadorned truth, while he tries
to reassure more than he informs, and yet makes it seem ominous,
dangerous and uncertain.  For his part, it is an unpleasant duty, and
Phoebe's reaction is unnervingly calm.  He is ill at ease and lacks
faith, and Phoebe, dreaming, sees all this and loves her father for
forcing himself to tell her these things.<p>

Now Phoebe dreams about that night, when a feast is held in her honour
at court. She sits between her parents, with her long silver hair
combed down her back, wearing an ornate silver gown, her quiet grey
eyes gazing solemnly at the revelry.  Among the entertainments of the
night there is a player, telling tales of giants slain and singing
songs of old romance.  He is not the man who will probe at the thorn
hedge, but Phoebe, dreaming, knows one to be the grandson of the
other.  The ten&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe barely notices him to his
verses, but sits lost all evening in thought and intuition, except
when called upon to thank this dancer or that magician.  But Phoebe,
dreaming, sees clearly how the player listens, and talks to courtiers
and servants alike, hearing all the gossip to make new tales. Even
ten&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe catches his glance once, and wonders,
though without needing to know, about the shrewdness and sympathy in
that gaze.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams again of the present, of faraway lands beyond her own.
Throughout them, small troubles brew and ferment: but none at the
moment large enough to threaten the world, no mighty leaders come to
impose their ways on all.  But Phoebe dreams of a desert land by
night, where a cool wind blows through a tower room, and around a king
and his best&#173;loved wife.  The king is a strong man and an
ambitious one, and wants great things for his heir.  Tonight, the
dreaming Phoebe knows already, his wife will conceive one for him,
beneath impatient stars.  The king has already decided that his eldest
son will be called Alexander.<p>

Watching them, Phoebe's hands move slightly upon the satin covers, and
she sees that her waiting begins to draw to a close.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams of the past again: of her mother, silver&#173;haired and
elegant, quiet, subtle, but as strong as Aurelius, in another way.
She dreams of her words at the christening, of how the kingdom would
sleep with Phoebe that she should not live cast out of her time, of
the thorn hedge that would grow to protect them all, and of the
promise of a saviour to waken Phoebe and the land.  She dreams of her
mother speaking to her in long hours together throughout her
childhood.  Sometimes she speaks of wisdom, and of arts and subtle
powers that are Phoebe's by birth: at other times she speaks of
dangers, of inevitable fate, and of the need for a sacrifice for the
good of others, and of a lifelong duty that is equally hers by birth.
Sometimes Phoebe does not understand, but she knows she will in time:
if not by her sixteenth birthday, then before she grows any older.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams again of Alexander, as he will be at eighteen, and
seasoned to battle.  His hundred cavalrymen are with him still, and
their reputation has spread beyond the kingdom: Alexander's father,
the king, is proud of his son and his skills, and today Alexander
rides on parade before a visiting ruler.  Phoebe watches Alexander
lead his men through sunlight and orange dust, and sees pride in his
expression.  And when he looks at the riches that the visiting ruler
displays, she sees ominous purpose added to that expression: a relief
from his boredom, and a way for him to be remembered through the years
to come.<p>

<br>

Phoebe's eyes flicker slightly beneath closed lids, as she dreams more
quickly, more urgently.  She dreams of the castle in which she lies;
of her father and mother, asleep on their thrones, showing faith in
her to the last; and of the Crone, asleep over a spinning wheel in a
room far above them all.  She dreams of her own sixteenth birthday,
held without ceremony, for what could be done in the face of that day?
At sixteen, Phoebe is still a quiet child, still distant from most of
the court, and more solemn than ever, on this, her special day.  Her
mother dresses her in a loose white gown, and makes sure that her bed
is fresh and ready.  Then she kisses Phoebe on the forehead and sends
her off to the highest tower in the castle, above her own rooms.
Queen Selene then goes to sit on her throne, to be with King Aurelius,
to set an example and to wait: at first for half an hour or so, but
then together for a hundred years.<p>

Phoebe dreams of her past self climbing flights of stairs, and today
she gets no bows or curtsies as she walks the corridors.  None of the
court wish to meet her today: none of them quite trust their reaction
if they should do so by accident, and King Aurelius has made his
position quite plain.  Although she looks calm, even to the dreaming
Phoebe, there is an undercurrent of nervousness in
sixteen&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe that dreaming Phoebe still remembers
and still feels some of, even in her sleep, with so much still to
do.<p>

Phoebe, dreaming, watches her younger self - younger in mind an
wisdom, if not in body - open the door to a small garret room, dim to
the eyes even in full daylight.  In it, the Crone is sitting, spinning
thread, and snapping it off at the right length.  She is still dressed
in black rags, but her face can be seen: pale, deep&#173;lined skin
drawn tight over bones, and clever black eyes sizing up Phoebe.  Her
hair, drawn back from her face, is just visible within her back hood,
and it is pale.  Phoebe, at sixteen, thought it grey: but now, in her
dream, it is the same silver as her own hair.  When the Crone speaks,
her voice is harsh and unmusical, but its tone is soft, and slightly
sorrowing.<p>

"Your mother told you what's to happen, child?"<p>

Sixteen&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe nods, mute.  Even dreaming, Phoebe
is not sure whether this is awe, fear or chosen silence.<p>

"Do you think you'll be strong enough?"<p>

Sixteen&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe nods again, and Phoebe, dreaming, is
unable to read her own expression.  The Crone also nods.<p>

"Yes, I think so.  It's what your life has been for since your
christening.  You'll understand the necessity in the years to come."
One sharp white hand extends from the black robes: the Crone offers a
branch of a thorn bush, and speaks once more.<p>

"My part ends with this.  Take the needle, and my blessing."<p>

Phoebe, shy, steps forward just far enough to take the branch: she
pricks herself on the thumb in grasping it, and jerks her hand back
immediately, surprise on her face, and a spot of red left on the
branch.  Her courage failing her, she turns and runs, as sleep steals
up on her.  The Crone watches her leave, and then settles her head in
a comfortable position, waiting for the magic to take her too.<p>

Sixteen&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe stumbles down the stairs and into
her own bedroom.  She crawls beneath the quilt before she falls
asleep, and as her breathing slows and deepens, as Phoebe dreaming
watches her, sixteen&#173;year&#173;old Phoebe becomes Phoebe dreaming
in her turn.<p>

<br>

Now Phoebe dreams of what might have been: of Alexander, who is not
yet born, as a grown man: and the dream becomes a nightmare.  She sees
him in armour, sword drawn, and he leads an army to conquest.  His
strategies and tactics are ingenious, his men love him, and his
diplomacy is skilled; he gains an empire.  But those he conquers do
not love him, those whose husbands fall in battle gain nothing and
lose much, and his fine words are founded on threats.  Phoebe dreams
of him, riding a pale horse at the head of his army, and it seems to
her that his sword trails fire that burns everywhere he passes.
Phoebe sees the world sacrificed to Alexander's ambition, to his
boredom, and to his quest to be remembered. Although she is dreaming,
she sees too clearly the lives ended and the lives twisted by his urge
to fill the gap in his impatient soul.  And, still asleep, still
dreaming, she twists beneath her satin quilt.  Still asleep, still
dreaming, she licks her lips, and just once she cries out: "No!"<p>

The word echoes out into the courtyard of the silent castle, where the
guards have not moved or spoken, have barely breathed, for eighty
years.  The silence returns.<p>

<br>

Phoebe breathes more deeply for a while, and does not dream, till her
breathing evens out once more.  Then she dreams of the future again.
She dreams of the court of Alexander's father, at a feast in
celebration of his nineteenth birthday.  A minstrel is telling
stories, and though it is not the one who tested the thorns outside
Phoebe's kingdom, she has already dreamed of how two players met and
swapped tales one night.  And indeed, one of the tales the minstrel
tells of of Phoebe, and of the curse laid both on her and on the
entire kingdom.  He embroiders the legend somewhat, but Phoebe's
beauty not at all, although he thinks he does.  Nevertheless, the
details are there, and Phoebe's land is named.  Alexander listens to
the tale and is intrigued by it.  Phoebe, dreaming, focuses on
Alexander and hopes he will act.  He asks the taleteller questions,
probes for specifics, and then asks his father leave to seek out the
kingdom, to see if he is the prince who will wake this princess with a
kiss.  Phoebe, dreaming, waits on the father's answer: but he can
refuse his heir nothing, and he knows how much Alexander needs purpose
and interest.  Alexander shall take his hundred cavalrymen with him as
escort, but he may go.  Already the tale and the challenge appeal, and
he is half in love with the unattainable princess.<p>

Phoebe, although asleep, knows the importance of this night that is
yet to come, and knows she will dream of it often.<p>

<br>

Phoebe dreams once more of the further future, after she has awoken.
She is older, and she is standing beside a new&#173;filled tomb,
weeping quietly but with all her heart.  A strong man is beside her,
holding her tightly.  He will be king now, but both Phoebe dreaming
and Phoebe bereaved can tell that he cares less for that than for the
sorrow King Aurelius' death has caused her.  Phoebe's mother is also
there, wearing a black robe and veil, and looking older: much of her
beauty has faded.  She has announced that she will retire from court
life, and live in a set of rooms in an upper tower, as her mother had
in the past.<p>

Outside, in the kingdom, the people are mourning, for Aurelius was a
good king.  But Phoebe is beautiful, and she has brought a handsome
young prince who will rule well in his turn, and this makes the people
of the kingdom glad.  They find that the future is not so dreadful
once it has arrived safely, and so they are also ready to
celebrate.<p>


Phoebe dreams of a traveller: Alexander, his imagination alight,
riding ahead of his mean towards the thorn trees.  He dismounts at
their foot, draws his sword, and walks forward, but Phoebe, dreaming,
knows they will not open for him.  Now a strange thing happens:
Phoebe, dreaming, dreams of Phoebe in her fine bed at the centre of
the kingdom, and dreams that she dreams of a passage opening in the
briar hedge.  Dreaming, Phoebe faintly remembers having dreamt of this
before, and that each time this happens: and a path does open up in
the thickets, lasting just long enough for Alexander, marvelling, to
enter, and closing in front of his men.<p>

Alexander moves through the hedges, his cloak never quite catching on
any thorns. He passes through them, and looks over Phoebe's kingdom,
seeing an early summer and a silence that must have lasted a hundred
years.  Phoebe, dreaming, sees his wonder at the magic here, and his
determination to reach the prize for which all this was set.  Two days
he walks through the still lands, drinking from a brook, but eating
nothing that he did not bring himself: for he sees how even the
flowers do not close at night, and he does not wish to risk such a
fate.<p>

He comes to the castle and enters, saluting the guards ironically.  He
listens carefully, and seems to hear the faint sound of true breathing
far above.  Phoebe, dreaming, wills him to the right path, and he
follows the sound up, up, up towards her room.  Phoebe, dreaming, sees
the black pillar and the white, sees the green satin quilt, sees the
silver hair, fine&#173;boned face and delicate hands.  She sees all
these things as he sees them all, fresh for the first time and long
sought after, and she dreams and sees his heart burn with love.  He
treads softly over towards Phoebe asleep, and kisses her gently on the
lips.<p>

Phoebe dreams that Phoebe awakes.  She still looks sixteen, but she is
older by a hundred years of dreaming.  For the first time, awake or
asleep, she smiles at him, and the hole in Alexander is filled.<p>

<br>

Phoebe, dreaming, dreams of a month later than that smile, and of her
wedding to Alexander.  He is dressed in golden court finery, having
put aside his soldier's uniform: she is wearing a bridal gown of
white, and her face is veiled.  Her father and mother are there: they
have welcomed Alexander as their own son.  Aurelius' face is filled
with joy, for he no longer needs faith, and his daughter has brought
him an heir.  Selene is smiling quietly, for she knows her daughter's
burden, but also knows of its necessity and its certainty of
success. She is tired: her magic has been spent, and she begins to
feel old.<p>

Phoebe, marrying, swears her vows with certainty and without
hesitation, and the ceremony is complete.  Alexander lifts her veil,
and finds her face still veiled, by reserve. Phoebe, dreaming, sees
that he thinks of this as nerves, and when he smiles, Phoebe wedded
smiles freely back as if with all her heart.<p>

Alexander takes Phoebe into his arms and kisses her once again, and
Phoebe, wedded, kisses him back and holds him, binding and fulfilling
him.  Both Phoebe dreaming and Phoebe wedded know that Alexander loves
her, and that this completes him, without his needing power and fame
to satisfy himself.  The people will love him, as a peace- loving
king, but Phoebe, who has dreamt of him in bloody conquest, will never
love him at all.<p>

Phoebe, bound, has only her dreams and the knowledge of her success to
sustain her, all the days of her life.  She has dreamt that it will be
enough.<p>

Tick.<p>

The second hand advances one notch, an eternity in microcosm, the
clock's face forever reflected in a statue's eyes, in the clock, an
infinite tunnel of deceit and double&#173;meaning.<p>

Pan round.  Break away (almost audibly) from that subtle entrapment of
soul, to view the scene outside.  Strange shapes loom from the fog,
leviathans lumbering in the deeps, pondering their own existence.
Draw a blank; nothing there.  Carry on.<p>

The door, hinting at further possibilities of outside.  Plain white
finish, brass handle.  Continue, growing restless now.<p>

Ah!  In the corner a television, the meaningless jumble of silent
images pouring forth from its bottomless well.  Stay here and watch as
a drama unfolds, or the news from some remote part of elsewhere
arrives, both events equally fictional.<p>

Look up and down, exploring the potential of a third dimension.
Quickly dismiss it; a bare light bulb hangs down from up there, feet
start up from down there.  No life here, no imagination.<p>

Scan back to eye level, to view... self.  A large mirror hangs on the
wall, showing ordinary features, average build, and beyond, a perfect
inverted image.  Prominent is the statue, its eyes filling (and in
turn, filled by) the world.  Turn away.<p>

Pause briefly at a print by Escher, hands of an artist in motionless
struggle for creation, captured timelessly by the unseen observer.  No
escape there.<p>

Finally come full circle in this small prison.  Observe the statue
more carefully now, zoom in.  A girl, 17 maybe.  Pretty, but blank.
Remember the salesman.<p>

Whip round at that sudden noise, a surreal intrusion into this world
of monochrome stillness. Scan the instant, unforgettable message
scribed upon that suddenly blank screen, some unseen announcer's
explanation.  Confuse bleak sans&#173;serif script with bleak
announcer's script.<p>

"Time is becoming non&#173;sequential.  Your ideas of past and future,
history and prediction, are now obsolete.  There is only here and now,
and the world is radically different.  The travellers are your guides
now."<p>

In the mirror, a twitch of sudden motion; a statue's gaze focuses.
Somewhere, memories fall neatly into place, meanings alter, and a
clock becomes strange.<p>

Tick.<p>

<h3>Julian Todd</h3>

An extremely large ark ship carried the embryos of a hundred million
species stored and catalogued by robot and computer. It was a
profitable enterprise which sold and bought species from the planets
it visited.<p>

During the five year interstellar night, the captain of the ship said
one day, "You know, I would really fancy a nice juicy steak."<p>

The engineer said, "It would be no trouble to take one out of the
store, grow it into calf and let the cook butcher it for you."<p>

"What a great idea!"<p>

The engineer fetched the relevant packet of specimens from the freezer
by remote control and slotted it into the 0.5 metre&#173;cubed
artificial womb. And five days later there emerged a 0.5
metre&#173;cubed litter of live rats who all started running around
the place.<p>

"I don't want to eat rats," said the captain.<p>

"It must have been a computer error."<p>

There were rats in the bedrooms, rats in the study and rats in the
control room zinging around like tennis balls with no gravity and
nothing to stop them. The trouble started when they each became hungry
and gnawed at everything they could get their tiny teeth
into. Fortunately, though they hurt, they didn't carry any nasty
diseases.<p>

"Why did you supply them with Calcium?" the captain said. "If they
hadn't grown up with so much Calcium, they wouldn't have such sharp
teeth. It would have been alright for the calf to have been born with
no bones, we were only going to eat it."<p>

"I was going to grow it into a fullsize bull and surprise you with
it."<p>

"For that you would have needed acres and acres of fresh grass. Now
sort <em>this</em> problem out and get some rats poison."<p>

"We haven't got any rat poison."<p>

"Then get us a cat."<p>

The 0.05 metre&#173;cubed womb delivered forth three baby hyenas.<p>

"Oh well, it'll have to do."<p>

The hyenas shrieked in he night when they were hungry and no one could
walk around the ship without their armour on. All likely weapons were
travel&#173;locked away for the duration of the trip because otherwise
by now the captain would have killed his stupid engineer.<p>

"Someone has either got to feed these beasts, or get something to kill
them."<p>

"I know, how about a nice juicy steak with razor blades embedded in
it?"<p>

"We don't want your rats all over again," said the captain. "Maybe the
reptile section doesn't have such a mixed&#173;up catalogue."<p>

"Lizards, dinosaurs, alligators?"<p>

"Snakes. A well trained cobra would do the trick."<p>

Fortunately, this item had too been miscatalogued. They only had to
contend with a venomless boa constrictor.<p>

A year later the captain was reported to have said, "I've had enough
of this farce, my ship is turning into a big stinking zoo with corpses
of things littering the corridors. We must have re&#173;established
all of the carnivorous food chains from three separate worlds out
there. What we need are some more crew members to help clear this mess
up - some organisms whose sole intention is not to go out and join the
fray."<p>

"I'll see to it immediately," said the engineer who had lost his arm
somewhere along the line.<p>

He came back with some tribal natives, but the captain had already
escaped in an emergency pod.<p>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

I was with my good friend Everton in the park when he was scattering
poison for the birds.  "It all began a couple of years ago," he said,
in answer to my question.  "I was walking along, minding my own
business when someone zipped past me on a bike.  He was closer to me
than you are now; I would only have had to stick out my hand and I
could have pushed him right off.  He was going at quite a speed too -
it would have been a nasty accident for the poor kid.  I didn't, of
course, but I saw no reason at the time why I shouldn't."<p>

He paused.

"No, that's not quite true," he said, and mournfully upended the last
of the poisoned seed onto the path.  Already some pigeons were taking
an interest.  "I wanted to push him off.  Quite badly, as a metter of
fact.  I don't know why; I still don't know why.  Heaven knows it
wasn't to harm the poor kid.  I don't want to cause harm to anyone.
And I've always hated practical jokes.  I don't do this for a laugh.
Come on."  We walked off.  Everton didn't once look back at the
pigeons.  I did; some of them had commenced hopping rapidly on the
spot or wildly fluttering their wings to the point of
half&#173;flight, as if mere action could free them from an internal
agitation.  I trotted after Everton to catch him up.<p>

"Your poison's starting to take effect," I told him.  He shrugged; he
wasn't interested.<p>

"Anyway, I didn't push him off, and the desire to left me as soon as
it was too late - leaving me rather appalled at the whole idea, let me
tell you.  I tried to put it out of my mind.  But the next day I was
sitting in the cafe where I have my lunch and I had got up to go when
I passed a table where a fat woman had got up to reach the salt, which
was way down the other end of the table.  I had an instant, a single
point, to pull away her chair before she sat down and all of a sudden
it seems the only thing in the world to do, a most natural and
inevitable action.  There seemed no point in <em>not</em> removing her
chair; it was just an act like any other."<p>

We had reached the flowerbeds in front of the park railings; Everton
stood actually in the earth, in front of a very fine rosebush whose
flowers he began to pull off (it was a half&#173;unconscious action,
done much as you or I might snap an elastic band around our fingers).
"Again I fought the feeling, and walked quickly on, but you must
understand it seemed unnatural to fight it.  I could not believe that
there would be any real consequence to my precipitating that fat lady
onto the floor.  I kept telling myself that it would be very
unpleasant for her, that she might even hurt herself, but I couldn't
bring myself to really feel any of this."  He stopped and looked at
me.  "I'm not actually selfish, you know, I've as much empathy as the
next man."  He turned back to his roses.  "I just have these urges to
do things."<p>

"What happened next?"<p>

"Well I sat wondering about it all afternoon, not getting any work
done, and decided to put it out of my mind, forget about it.  But I
couldn't help feeling that that afternoon things were coming together
for me - like I was on the crux of new thoughts, or a new thing.
Everything seemed more real just then."  He sighed.  "I think that was
just that afternoon lazy feeling.  Anyway, when I was walking home I
had just turned into our road when another boy rode by me on a bike,
standing up in his saddle to get some speed up.  I didn't need to
think about it much; I just reached out and pushed him over.  He hit
the ground hard, the bike's behind skidded from under him towards me.
It was a very clumsy fall; he wasn't expecting it.  I instantly ran
over and apologised, said I'd suddenly slipped sideways, helped him
up, asked if he was hurt.  He looked at me darkly, recovered his bike
and went on his way without saying a word.  After all, it wasn't as if
he could believe I'd done it on purpose, could he?<p>

"As for me, I wasn't particularly elated, or anything.  It seemed no
more of any consequence than making a cup of tea or putting my tie on;
just a normal event in the day.  The boy just seemed to have been
there at the wrong time, that's all.  I went out the next morning and
broke everyone's milk bottles with a brick when they weren't looking.
It was just something I wanted to do."<p>

We wandered on.  "I didn't want to tell anyone, of course.  I've only
told you because you caught me slashing your tyres.  But I've got a
bit worried about it now.  You know Muriel's left me.  Well, it was
because I started hitting her.  I'd just walk up to her and hit her in
the face, or I'd call her into the room and kiss her and then slap her
across the ear.  I did love her, you understand, and I'm miserable
without her, but my God I don't blame her for leaving me.  I'd have
left her if she'd started hitting me."  His eyes were full of pain as
he looked at me to make sure I understood him.  "I'd have done
anything in the world for her.  I just wanted to know what it looked
like to hit someone.  I couldn't tell her the real reason, so she
thought I'd stopped loving her.  I wish I hadn't made her so
miserable.  Somehow I couldn't explain.  I think it's because I didn't
want her to think badly of me."  He gave an unhappy snort of a laugh
and blew his nose, then turned away.  "There's a joke."  There was a
pause.  "Look out for the park keeper for me, will you?  I'm going to
put this barley&#173;sugar in his motor mower."<p>

He rejoined me after a couple of minutes.  I was concerned.  "Aren't
you worried about all this?" I asked.<p>

"That's what I've been meaning to tell you, old boy."  His voice was
quiet.  "There's an old woman down the road... No, no that's not it.
I've got another compunction, one for another outrageous deed.  I keep
on wanting to confess it all.  Don't lets just stand here; I've got
some pliers and I know where the kids leave their bikes; we can go and
cut their brake cables.  It's just that I want people to know what
I've been doing; it's not enough to just do something.  Anyway, it
can't do any harm.  What'd you do if I pushed you off your bike and
then came up to you and apologised and confessed?  You'd hardly go to
the bother of taking me to court for pushing you off your bike, would
you?  It'd never be worth it.  After all, you never did anything about
your tyres, did you?"<p>

That was the last time I saw my friend Everton.  Three days later he
murdered the old lady down his road by hitting her repeatedly on the
head with a cricket bat, then he went and confessed it to the local
police.  They put him in a mental asylum; he sent me a letter which
was most indignant about it.  He never struck me as being insane.<p>



<hr><a name="afantasy"><h2>A Fantasy in Motion</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

It was a clear day in a magical foreign land.  The sky was a deep
crisp blue, with the texture of a fresh&#173;bitten apple.  The sun
bathed an alien landscape with a warm glow (of course, it was
filtered; unprotected, no&#173;one could survive it for long).<p>

The screens above diffused the light, and poured it (like honey)
slowly over the surface below.  A small lake nestled like a liquid
jewel in the hollow, and caught a portion of the light within its
depths. A picturesque bridge arched delicately over the water, with an
elegance not possible on Earth.<p>

Behind the lake, a short walk away, a small cluster of dwellings
thrust up from the ground, some short and stubby, some stately or
grand, some reaching elegantly for the sky.<p>

All about, peaceful fields soaked up the sun's energy.  A few lazy
hang&#173;gliders hung in the air like the hawks imported from Earth.
One, going too high like Icarus, did a curious half&#173;loop and
twisted in the air, its pilot a faint speck in the blue.<p>

Far to the north and south, the rolling contours were confused in the
foothills of mountains.  East and west, the horizon seemed lost in a
haze.  Above, more hills and lakes, set between the huge sky
panels.<p>

Bridges, Chief Construction Supervisor for the L5 community, stood
atop a small mound and surveyed his cylindrical domain, eyes shaded
from the blue.  Behind him was one of the sky&#173;panels, filter
turned off now for the splendid view.<p>

Of course, this was all in the future, and Bridges ran a
well&#173;practiced eye over the plans and drawings of the interior,
as he floated near the recently installed sky&#173;panel.  The filters
were not operational yet, so he had to rely on his pressure&#173;suit
to shield his eyes.<p>

Yes, he thought, we'll put some buildings there, and a lake there.
We'll run a stream down from the Far End waterfall.  All of that will
be hills and fields, maybe even a vineyard.  The shell's interior
started to form in his mind as a skeletal vision of what was to be.<p>

In fact, fairly soon, they would be putting the spin on.  All the
structural work had been completed, and they could start landscaping
when they had gravity and atmosphere.  Centrifugal force was an old
misconception, but one that Bridges thought would endure.  It must be
odd to live with nothing below but nothing.<p>

Indeed, even now the surface seemed to be moving below him.  The giant
rockets welded to the outside would be straining to create some
semblance of specific gravity.  He could almost (but not quite)
imagine the slow rumble of motion, the ponderous creak as ancient
gears and levers came back into operation after millenia of disuse,
and the cylinder came alive.<p>

Slowly, too slowly, it picked up speed, and finally, a tinny
imp&#173;like voice sounded inside his helmet.  "OK Chief, we've
finished.  We have one half gee on the inner surface.  Wanna take a
stroll?" That's not a bad idea, thought Bridges.  He glided forward
with a brief burst of power, and having matched the rotational speed
of the hull, landed lightly on his feet with another small burst from
the jets.<p>

He was the first against the wall when the revolution came.<p>



<hr><a name="saviouro"><h2>The Saviour of the World</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

A man in his office: Sir Andrew Mandelay, head of the United Nations'
Space Fleet.  In walked his chief pilot, Captain Adam Action, DSO.
"You wanted to see me, Sir," he said, but did not salute; despite the
thirty&#173;year difference in their ages, the two had long been firm
friends.  They had been through much together.<p>

But for once, Sir Andrew did not seem glad to see his ablest pilot.
He stood awkwardly away from Adam, looking out through the window
which formed the whole west wall of his office and gave a high view of
the runways of Space Fleet Central.  He did not turn round.  "Adam,
sit down would you?" he said, and then he turned, and Adam was
surprised to see the pain in his eyes.  "I've got something to tell
you."<p>

"What is it, Sir?  You seem unhappy about something," said the cheery
space pilot as he complied with his superior's wishes.  "Has something
come up?"<p>

Sir Andrew stayed by the window.  "You know, don't you, that our
psionics research workshops were doing some particular work on space
travel."<p>

"Yes, as a metter of fact they did some tests on me.  I'm not sure I
believe in it, though.  Mental powers seem a rum go to me; give me a
spaceship and the stars in my face any day."<p>

"It's about those tests that I wanted to see you, Adam," Sir Andrew
said.  "They've come up with something."  He walked forward from the
window to stand in from of the captain, who noticed that he held his
hand in his pocket in an odd fashion.  As never before he seemed very
old and tired.  "Adam - " He paused, then began again.  "Adam, has it
never occurred to you that it's rather odd - the way Earth keeps
getting invaded?  Alien forces have tried to take over our planet
countless times in the past ten years since you first went up in a
spaceship and landed on the moon."<p>

"Not really, Sir.  It's only natural that evil space invaders should
wish to add a healthy young planet to their empires.  For the first
time we've drawn attention to ourselves with space travel.  Besides,
it isn't just aliens.  There was <em>Actaeon</em>, the giant defence
computer which went mad and which I had to sneak into and deprogram
before it started nuclear war.  And you yourself helped me to defeat
Elmo Suggs and his army of miniature assassins - "<p>

"Adam, the Mekon has tried to invade seventeen times in the past
decade, and keeps getting away in a secret space capsule to try again.
Don't you think he'd want to give up having his Treen armies shot down
by you?"<p>

"No, Sir, he'll never learn, but we'll get him next time, don't
worry."<p>

"Why must there be a next time?  Each invasion or peril from deep
space ravages the Earth still further.  We can't take many more
calamities.  Do you know the cost of the rebuilding programmes we have
to keep instituting again and again?<p>

The young captain did not quail.  "We'll give them the best we've got.
They'll never make Earthmen bow down, by Jiminy!  Is that why you
wanted to see me?  Do we need to fight again?"<p>

"Adam, the psionics boys looked at your tests.  It isn't Earth the
aliens are after - it's you."<p>

"What?"<p>

"I don't pretend to understand the science of it.  But you give off
what they call a Dramatic Adventure Field, or DRAMAD.  You're an
immensely powerful psychic.  It's you who're causing these things to
happen.  Your mind is creating adventure for you to take part in."<p>

"I don't understand."  Adam stared in amazement up at the face of his
friend.<p>

"I'm sorry, Adam.  Earth cannot pay the price for your mind.  I've
been ordered special powers."  With his duty to be done, Sir Andrew
had strengthened himself; his head was high, but his eyes were still
sad.  His hand, still inside his jacket pocket, was raised so that it
projected towards Adam's chest.  "We will build you a statue when you
are dead."<p>

"Dead?"  With the threat imminent, Adam fast lifted himself half from
the chair, but Sir Andrew fired and two bullets crashed through Adam's
chest and were stopped in the horsehair chair behind.  He fell back,
dead and bloody, his eyes still open in stupor.  Sir Andrew wanted to
say he was sorry, but his eyes just filled with tears.<p>

Later that day, they found that all of the spaceship drives no longer
worked.<p>

but the author claims "I just woke up, a verse popped into my head and

<hr><a name="awomanin"><h2>A Woman in Space (Sara Cavanaugh)</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

It is probable that you have never heard of this book or this author,
since the book in incompetent and the author patently deranged; were
it not for the fact that the book is in the CUSFS library it would
never have forced its existence onto my consciousness.  The book is,
it proclaims, a Tiara novel; the first sentence of the blurb reads,
"She's young, she's lovely - she's an astronaut."  Carol Collins is
sent on a mission into space to find lost astronauts, in the course of
which she makes a stand against the ubiquitous male chauvinism and
finds true love.  We are not, then, dealing with science fiction but
merely (as it appears for the first hundred pages) with a standard
romance which has a space opera plot as scenery for the main business
of the love story.  It's grasp of actual science is easily mocked; in
this scene Carol and her co&#173;pilot have been sucked into space by
a mysterious force:<p>

"`I kind of rule out a magnetic field,' Carol continued musingly, `We
aren't subject to G&#173;forces... My guess would be a
force&#173;field of some kind.  An electronic beam, or perhaps some
kind of cosmic ray?'  `Do you think the Commies are behind it?'"<p>

The characters are no more than a set of perambulating obsessions,
each with one attribute to distinguish them from the others.  The
dialogue is trite and absurd; the prose is embarrassing.  Why then am
I drawing this apparently average piece of rubbish to your attention?
Because it is not simple Mills&#173;and&#173;Boon offal, though it is
well camouflaged as such.  The book's claim to future notoriety
appears with the sudden appearance of some `space&#173;bunnies' - five
beautiful and nubile alien girls who have not seen a man bar their
fathers for fifteen years.  At this point the book at last reaches the
core of the story, and it proves to be very weird indeed.  The plot
becomes no more notable or elegant, but the attitudes implicitly
espoused become frankly extremely worrying.  For we are treated to a
catalogue of pornography and vice as would surely leave the casual
romance&#173;hunter flabbergasted.  We have prostitution (both forced
and willing), orgies, voyeurism, infidelities, nymphomania, an
extraordinary and disturbing psychopathy which everyone seems to
accept as normal, corruption of minors, jingoism, condoned sexual
harassment, promises of rape, homophobia, adultery, seductions,
manipulations, misogyny (a medieval attitude towards women <em>which
is even considered desirable by the book's one supposed feminist
character</em> - and the author has some extraordinary ideas about the
nature of feminism), basic apathy to appalling crimes, and - quite the
worst of all - a cheery simplemindedness which accepts the shallowest
whims of the human mind as governing the deeds of the world.  This is
ids in space.<p>

Yet on its own, apart from the pseudo&#173;feminism, this still would
be little worthy of comment.  There is little wrong with lashings of
outer&#173;space sex, as readers of Norman Spinrad will tell you.
What renders the book's convulsions unhealthy is the sheer prurience
of the pornography.  It is all the time exhibiting its wares as
peek&#173;a-boo titillation in a way even Gor never stoops to.  The
author tries to glory in shock&#173;tactic exhibitions and leer at
them as well.  It is this double&#173;standard that sets the seal on
the book's inner rot.  This book is a little death of quality, of
morality, of thought, of feeling; it is a celebration of degradation
and slavery; I urge you all to read it immediately - know thine
enemy.<p>



<hr><a name="tekwarwi"><h2>TekWar (William Shatner)</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

<blockquote>James T Kirk looked up at the seethru plasglass
viewscreen, a big window in the side of the spaceship.  The Klingons
were bombarding him with energy beams, and the control room lurched as
if the camera was being tilted.<p>

"She canna take any more of this, Captain!" came a crackled voice from
the engine room, as various bits of equipment around the room exploded
in a shower of dust and cardboard, and Spock died horribly on the
floor.  Kirk managed to tear his shirt to show off the manly chest
beneath, as the Enterprise met its final...<p>

Jake Cardigan ripped off the electrodes, and lay sweating on the bed.
Damn it, this Tek stuff is realistic, he thought.  His illegal Tek
setup lay on the bed beside him: a pocket calculator connected to the
headset, a Z80 chip and some 1.5V batteries.  It was partly Tek that
had got him into the freezer in the first place.<p>

Jake snatched up his lazgun as a gleaming broad&#173;shouldered robot
entered the hotel room, wearing a poncho and whistling the theme tune
from some 20th century spaghetti western.  "Go on punk," it said,
trying for an appropriate idiom but getting the wrong movie; "make my
day."  Jake fired a crackling beam of purple light at the mechanical
man; he had to find Professor Kittridge and his lovely daughter Beth
before time ran out.<p>

Their anti&#173;Tek device worked on high&#173;frequency radio waves,
and could render every single Tek chip in the universe useless.  He
had to find the Kittridges before Tek lord Sonny Hokori did.<p>

At this point, the wall became an intense sizzling orange, and fell
away to gritty dust.  Insane IDCA (International Drug Control Agency)
official Kurt Winterguild made a dramatic entrance, and started
shooting from the hip...<p>

William Shatner ripped off the electrodes, and lay sweating on the
bed.</blockquote>

<cite>TekWar</cite> has been described as a cross between <cite>Star
Trek</cite> and T J Hooker.  I do not think this assertion fair; the
book doesn't owe a lot to <cite>Star Trek</cite>.  There are rumours
that <cite>TekWar</cite> was not written by William Shatner, but that
it was ghost&#173;written.  I find this hard to believe; he may have
had a little help with it (he says as much in the acknowledgements),
but the basic ideas could not have come from anyone else.<p>

So, what about the plot?  Framed policeman Jake Cardigan is paroled
from the orbiting freezer colony (They put people in suspended
animation, as punishment) after 4 years of his 15 year sentence to
find that his wife has left him, and a private detective agency wants
him to find Professor Kittridge and daughter, after their
disappearance in Mexico.<p>

Shatner says "Tek" (misspelt as "Trek" on page 65) stands for
technology.  Tek is an electronic drug, in the form of computer chips
(this isn't explained too well); it lets "tekkies" escape from reality
by connecting electrodes to their heads.  Professor Kittridge has
invented a machine that destroys Tek chips by emitting high frequency
radio waves (I'm not kidding; that's what it says in the book!), so it
is vital that Kittridge be rescued.<p>

Jake meets a string of sordid characters (shooting most of them) and
follows a trail toward the bad guys, much in the linear style of a
Mickey Spillane novel.  Okay, so much for the plot.<p>

Shatner has invented lots of phrases, such as seethru, plasglass,
skycar, aircab, lazgun and neodenim.  It's an attempt at the evolution
of language over time, but it just comes over as cheap.  He also
mentions legal marijuana cigarettes (oh no not again, I hear you cry;
Spinrad did it better).<p>

The other main way in which the book fails is in its treatment of
robots; they are all humanoid and speak idiomatic English or Spanish.
Although in a bordello this is understandable, it seems that Shatner
does not really think of them as machines, but as manufactured humans
(and yes, he really does use the phrase "mechanical man", dreadful
though it is).<p>

In short, this book is awful, but well worth reading.  The
characterisation is almost non&#173;existent (no prizes for guessing
who plays Cardigan in the film), the plot simplistic and the science
fiction cliched.<p>

I should mention at this point (before you go away thinking "I will do
my best to avoid this book") that a sequel is on the way, entitled
<cite>TekLord</cite>.  Well, you can't win them all.  I may even do a
review of that too.<p>



<hr><a name="starkben"><h2>Stark (Ben Elton)</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

<cite>Stark</cite> is a deeply depressing book.  It would be hard to
describe complete "eco&#173;doom" (a phrase used generously by Elton,
up there with "avalanche effect", "vanishing point" and "total toxic
overload") and not be so.  The one excuse for this morbid theme is the
blas&eacute; attitude with which it is treated; one is at once
involved with and detached from the Earth's downward spiral.<p>

Nor is it light reading (I measure it at 1.18"), and having waded
through its ups and downs (though mostly downs), I found myself
disappointed with the ending.  I had, through the final chapters, been
wondering how they could get out of <em>that</em>, and with what
miraculous device the plot could be saved, but I came to the sad
conclusion that perhaps it couldn't.<p>

The real problem I had with this book was its protagonists.  They are
either two&#173;dimensional, irritating or pathetic; the main
characters include a total prat and a weird psychopathic hippy.  I
cannot sympathise with these people; in fact, I felt more at home with
the bad guys.  I kept reading mainly because I wanted to know what
Stark were up to, and how the self&#173;styled EcoAction group would
stop them.<p>

Do not be put off.  Inside its shiny and embossed cover, the book is
enjoyable, if perhaps over&#173;speckled with colourful verbs and
adjectives.  It has rich and varied descriptions, inventive metaphors
and cunning double&#173;takes.<p>

Also, if Elton's proposals are pessimistic, at least he's done his
research well.  He makes out the Earth's ecology to be more fragile
than it probably is, but the situation is plausible and
well&#173;presented.  A warning, then, in which the Earth dies not
with a bang, or a whimper, but with a belated slump, and a final
gurgle.<p>



<hr><a name="islandsin"><h2>Islands in the Net (Bruce
Sterling)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

The future portrayed in this impressive and powerful novel owes a lot
to cyberpunk but attempts to go beyond the merely technical to look at
the political implications.  By the mid&#173;twenty&#173;first
century, nuclear weapons have been abolished and the world is
apparantly at peace, policed by a strict and powerful international
organisation.  Nations no longer seem to be important (why is this a
feature of cyberpunk novels?) and the dominant forces seem to be the
multinational corporations, the global data net, and the police.<p>

But there are countries outside the cosy insularity of the First
World, places which are cut off from the Net and have to survive by
being outside the law.  Data havens, they are called, peopled by
ruthless data pirates.  Grenada in the Caribbean is one such island in
the Net, Singapore another and Africa a third, left to wallow in
tribal war, a global dumping&#173;ground for the outdated weapons of
the cold war.<p>

Opinions are divided on how to deal with the data havens.  The
Japanese multinationals want to declare war and usher in a new order
of corporate world&#173;rule.  The Americans prefer to negotiate,
attempting to tempt the pirates into legitimacy with the promise of
trade.<p>

The heroine, Laura Webster, belongs to the US `corporate democracy'
Rizome Industries, and as the novel opens she is only concerned with
her family and career, gradually advancing her popularity and power in
her company (to which she directs her loyalties rather than the US).
However, when a data pirate is assassinated during the delicate
negotiations she is hosting she is forced to expand her horizons.  She
journeys as a diplomat to Grenada, to Singapore and finally to darkest
starving Africa as terrorism and war break out all around her.<p>

Who are the villains in this story?  The multinationals are greedy and
power&#173;hungry, yes, but on the other hand Rizome is a model of
democracy and consensus.  The data havens of the third world are
ruthless and unafraid to use violence and terrorism, but Sterling is
not so quick to condemn.  The Grenadians explain that they have been
systematically ignored and marginalised by an inward&#173;looking and
contemptuous First World who have now forfeited all right to impose
their standards of judgement.<p>

By the close of <cite>Islands in the Net</cite>, Laura has been shaken
out of her complacency, determined to fight for a better world.  The
book ends with war and a global power struggle looming on the horizon,
and nothing resolved.  There are no glib resolutions or easy answers
here.<p>



<hr><a name="rimrunne"><h2>Rimrunners (C J Cherryh)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Another novel in Cherryh's extensive `Merchanter' future history,
taking place soon after the events of <cite>Downbelow Station</cite>
as the Alliance takes on the task of hunting down the remnants of
Earth's defeated fleet.<p>

Thule station is a decrepit outpost in the Hinder Stars, bypassed by
newer ships and newer routes, peopled by refugees from the
Union&#173;Alliance war desperate for a place on a ship going
somewhere prosperous.  Bet Yeager is one such, once a marine with the
Earth fleet, now destitute on Thule docks, hoping for a crew berth on
a ship, terrified of revealing her identity to the Alliance
authorities, and prey for violent men.<p>

Then <em>Loki</em> docks, obviously an Alliance spy ship, but it takes
Bet (though it must first rescue her from police trying to account for
two bodies).  On board, she befriends a young man, Ramey, called NDG
(for "No Damn Good") and victimised by the rest of the crew.  She is
forced to confront <em>Loki</em>'s officers for his sake, even as
<em>Loki</em> hunts her old comrades.<p>

The questions mount as the book goes on.  Where are Bet's loyalties,
with <em>Loki</em>, or with her old ship?  Where are Ramey's?  And
what is <em>Loki</em>'s true purpose?<p>

Finding the answers is satisfying, and though the novel seems to lack
substance compared to some of her other work, Cherryh's writing is at
her most tense and exciting, and that's enough to keep you turning the
pages.<p>



<hr><a name="folkofth"><h2>The Folk of the Fringe (Orson Scott
Card)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

<cite>Folk of the Fringe</cite> consists of five loosely linked
stories set following a nuclear war which left the Mormon community in
Utah as the only coherent civilisation in the US.<p>

"West" is a science&#173;fictional re&#173;telling of the original
Mormon pioneering journeys, following a group of Mormons fleeing from
persecution in the East to the promised land of Utah.  "Salvage" is a
slight story about the Mormon Tabernacle, drowned by the rising waters
of Salt Lake.  "The Fringe" tells the story of a brilliant young
disabled teacher battling corruption in a frontier farming community,
and is quite a moving tale.  "Pageant Wagon" is another Card story
about a close family with deep problems that are healed by a wise
stranger (reminiscent of <cite>Speaker For the Dead</cite> or
<cite>Seventh Son</cite>).<p>

"America" is the best of the five, and rather different in spirit.  A
young (North) American man and an older Brazilian women fall in love,
becoming the parents of a brilliant general and demagogue who unites
the Indian peoples of America against the European descendants.  There
are strong hints that this has been brought about by the Indian god
Quetzalcoatl in order to rid the land of the foreign settlers.  Card
is quite adept at evoking the mystery of the old Indian religion and
of the Amazon jungle, although the superstitious nature of the story
sits oddly with the rational sf of the earlier four stories.<p>

Two main themes link the stories in <cite>The Folk of the
Fringe</cite>.  As the title suggests, they are concerned with people
on the fringe of society; outsiders and outcasts.  They also seem to
be an affirmation of Card's own Mormon faith, expressed through the
medium he is most proficient with.<p>



<hr><a name="barsoomp"><h2>The Barsoom Project (Larry Niven & Steve
Barnes)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

This novel is a rather disappointing sequel to <cite>Dream
Park</cite>, mostly because it uses the same formula plot that the
earlier novel, offerring very little novelty: a live role&#173;playing
game is taking place with espionage and murder behind the scenes.
There are no surprises, and the characters are even more cardboard
than is usual for Niven.<p>

The only saving grace is the interesting and unusual setting for the
game: an arctic spirit world based on the legends and traditions of
the Inuit.  But this is a credit only to the writers' research and not
to their writing skills.<p>



<hr><a name="quiverin"><h2>The Ex&#173;Chairman's Address, or, The
Quivering</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

</strong>Warning</strong> Some readers may find the next paragraphs
offensive, sick or disgusting.<p>

<blockquote>The victim's final, gushing scream of agony was muffled by
the mis&#173;shapen thing straddling her face, feeding on the tasty
morsels already shredded by its cruel claws.  An eyeball burst,
flooding the ravaged flesh with viscous fluid.  The other eye stared
mindlessly into a jumbled collection of parts borrowed from previous
meals.  Further down, two more of the creatures were fighting over the
more choice remains; the breasts and soft inner thighs had gone, as
had the entrails, and what might have been a liver waited patiently in
a selection of grisly remains.  The chest heaved once in a parody of
life, as if the lungs had drawn breath for a hopeless plea of denial,
and another distorted head burst from beneath the ribcage, sated from
its feast.  One of the fingers beckoned spastically in reflex action,
as the nerves were severed (like worms in a clod of earth suddenly
exhumed).<p>

At the top of the cellar steps, the insane megalomaniacal Chairman
looked down into the slowly churning pool of muscle and organ,
patrolled by the salivating monsters.  Several nervous tics jumped on
his face, as he cackled at the fate of his most recent victim.  "Once,
they laughed at me.  They sneered at my collection of L Ron Hubbard,
and made jokes behind my back.  Well they haven't heard the last of
me! Wait 'til I unleash my pets on the world!  Ha ha ha!"  As he
spoke, a new creature pulled itself together out of the flesh
remaining, and started mewling like a new&#173;born child.  Soon, it
began to feed.</blockquote>

Right.  Well, that was an experiment in a different style of writing.
I wanted to see if I could do it, and next issue (if the Editor
doesn't ban the idea entirely), you will have something completely
different.  I would like to use this column partly to force my insane
gibberings on a captive audience, and partly to print any snippets of
information that I find interesting.  For instance, last year's Vice
Presidents (don't ask me to explain them) were:

<blockquote><pre>
Miss P Bordes
.
The Ex&#173;Chairman's coat
Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians
$h - $h$+G$&#173;$h$o$&#173;M$+$h$gpi$crm
Severian the Torturer
</pre></blockquote>

This year (after the exams), I shall be running the Vice President
elections myself (results to be printed in the next issue), so I would
like members to be ready to put forward up to six candidates each, and
I will put together a voting form.<p>



<hr><a name="endgameg"><h2>Endgame</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Funny how traditions start, isn't it?  <cite>ttba</cite> editors have
nearly always written a piece at the back of the magazine, if out to
pad out the final page, or to round off an issue they put hard work
into, but only in the last couple of years has it become traditional
to put a distinctive title on it (Julian Todd had `Exit Ramp', Simon
Arrowsmith `Way Out' and you can see my feeble choice above).  But
Cambridge is necessarily tradition&#173;riddled, and even a forward
looking society like ours is bound to become infected - or why else
has this magazine retained its silly title for so long?<p>

Anyway, I'd like to thank Simon for doing such a marvellous job of
editing <cite>ttba</cite> this past year (I can only hope to build on
his achievement).  I'd also like to thank Huw for providing
much&#173;needed help with <cite>Teenage Turtle Brainwashed
Assassins</cite>.<p>

Those of you who don't come to social meetings and haven't received
newsletters (John Meredith assures me he has the distribution system
perfected by now) will be wondering who the new committee are.  Well,
what more encouragement do I need?<p>

The Chairperson is <strong>Barry Traish</strong>, a first year NatSci
from Catz, shortly to become a Philosopher for no very good reason.
Between CUSFS and work he manages to be a hack journalist at the
<cite>Weekly Revue</cite> and a Don Juan Extraordinaire.<p>

<strong>John Burnham</strong> (Churchill, NatSci) is our Secretary.  A
man with a tragic but secret past, John's main hobby is waving large
knifes at people at threatening to remove their extremities.<p>

The Treasurer is <strong>Simon Pick</strong> (Anglo&#173;Saxon, Norse
and Celtic, Peterhouse).  A lone artist in a society of scientists, he
has the last laugh, for he can read the <cite>J&oacute;msvikinga
Saga</cite> in the original Icelandic.  Thankfully for me, he is also
a prolific writer.<p>

The Membership Secretary and Custodian of the CUSFS filespace is
<strong>John Meredith</strong>, a second&#173;year NatSci from
Downing, renowned for his dry wit and consumption of vodka.<p>

<strong>Tim Morley</strong> (Sidney Sussex, NatSci) is Librarian, and
currently rather annoyed at the prospect of having to take care of
3,000 books in his room when the Union Society kick us out of their
building.<p>

And finally, er... there's me.  <strong>Gareth Rees</strong>
(Christ's, Maths).  If you want to find out about me, buy me a drink
sometime...<p>

The outgoing committee decided this year to hand over responsibility
immediately following the elections, rather than at the end of term,
as has been customary in the past, in order to give us a couple of
months' experience in running the society before we get faced with
hordes of freshers next term.<p>

Records department: as I mentioned in the editorial, there doesn't
seem to have been any real attempt to keep records of the history of
the society.  There are therefore a whole host of unanswered questions
about the history of CUSFS: Is it true that the society was founded by
Charles Platt in 1963?  Why was <cite>ttba</cite> started?  And why
couldn't anyone think of a good title?  Who was Nick Lowe?  Why did he
and Walter Rothschild run for the CSU (as it was then) executive?  Did
CUSFS really have a voting majority on the committee of the Graduate
Union?  Why does Douglas Adams hate Cambridge so much?  Why did
someone persuade Barry Traish to become chairperson?  Perhaps these
questions should remain unanswered, but I'm asking them anyway...<p>

What I would like to do is to put together a comprehensive history of
the society in time for the next <cite>ttba</cite>, or perhaps the one
after.  So if your memory goes back further than last week, write a
piece for the history, whether it be trivial or important.
Discussions, elections, people, places, fish&#173;fights, conventions
and waffles - the story needs to be told!<p>

Even if you are not much of a historian, your contributions are still
needed.  <cite>ttba</cite> will print anything: serious fiction, light
fiction, appalling puns, articles, political commentary, news, views,
reviews, letters to the editor, cartoons, illustrations (and these
don't <em>have</em> to have titles with a certain set of four
initials) and indeed truly anything else.  Although previous editors
have set standards high enough that material has been rejected
(believe it or not).  I have a small folder of rejections containing,
among other things, and anarchist newsletter, a truly dreadful piece
entitled `Standing at the Edge (of Time)' and a description of a
physics practical...<p>

So if you want to apply for that rare and valuable item, the
<cite>ttba</cite> rejection letter, you can write for the next issue,
which is planned to come out at the start of next term, in time for
the societies' fair, so it would be an appropriate time to submit your
views on the society, or to write an article explaining why new
members should be reading Orson Scott Card instead of Isaac Asimov (or
whatever).<p>

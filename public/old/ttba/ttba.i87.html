<hr><a name="editoria"><h2>Editorial: Tom's Troubles to Bangor's
Advantage?</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

The shock news at <cite>Uniconze</cite> (the eleventh universities' sf
convention) was that <cite>Icon</cite>, expected to be the successful
(and only) bid for the 1991 Unicon, had folded when its moving spirit,
Tom Yates, declared his intention to cease attending sf cons.  As
con&#173;goers are no doubt aware, Unicon 12 was rescued by a group
from Bangor, who now have the unenviable task of putting together a
con in twelve months.  I wish them (and <cite>Mabinogicon</cite>) the
best of luck - see you there!<p>

But what caused Mr. Yates to become so thoroughly dissatisfied with sf
conventions that he should stop attending the even at the cost of
causing <cite>Icon</cite> to fail?  Here is how he explained his
decision:<p>

<blockquote>Sf hasn't been the forum for pulp writing for some time
now.  These days, it's probably the premier forum for angry writing.
This is the prose of dissatisfaction with government, with the ethics
of society, and with the dreadful silence from God, which passes all
understanding.  When I read a book of stature, I seek out my friends
to tell them about it.  But somehow, when I turn to these educated and
literate friends, and say "Have you read <cite>SmallCreep's
Day</cite>?, or perhaps <cite>Paladin of the Lost Hour</cite>", they
are wise to me, and say, "That's Science Fiction, isn't it?"  This
tears me up, this bigotry against a whole panoply of writing that
needs eyes, of words that need ears, and I wonder why they will
neither see nor hear.<p>

Well, I've finally worked it out.  Sf will not climb out of its hole
as long as it is perceived as literature for children of all ages.  It
is the responsibility of those who organise conventions, and those who
attend them, as the ambassadors of the writing, to appear to the
public as they would have that writing seen.  Sadly, a lot of the
people I have met at conventions seem to have failed to grow up.  Such
a failing I can allow in 20&#173;year&#173;olds, but a weekend of
immature 40&#173;year&#173;olds, all ranting and wanting their own
way, with a side order of chauffeur&#173;driven filter coffee, now, is
more than I can bear with equanimity.  Perhaps this is a failing in
me, rather than in the body of fans, but it's a failing I believe to
be shared by that public upon whom you are trying to press the new
image of sf.  If you don't improve your image, then sf will continue
to sit at the back of shelves, and remain the province of people who
seem not to have become wholly adult.<p>

For me, it's come to the point where I shall no longer be going to
conventions.  The larger children have driven me away, and to them,
for the sake of science fiction as an artform, I say grow
up.</blockquote>

('Children of the Damned', <cite>Intermediate Reptile 10</cite>)<p>

I was going to write a piece in defence of sf conventions, when I
discovered that Ursula LeGuin had already written one better than I
ever could, in her GoH speech at WorldCon '75:<p>

<blockquote>When you come right down to it, we've come here to enjoy
ourselves.  We aren't going to accomplish anything, you know, or
establish anything, or sell anything.  We're not here in order to make
a new law, or declare a war, or fix the price per barrel of crude oil.
No, and thank God we're not.  There are enough people involved in that
kind of rubbish.<p>

We are here, I think, in hope, and some confidence, that we'll like
each other.  We're here to enjoy ourselves, which means we are
practicing the most essentially human of all undertakings, the search
for joy.  Not the pursuit of pleasure - any hamster can do that - but
the search for joy.  And may I wish to you all here that you find
it.</blockquote>

('The Stone Ax and the Muskoxen', <cite>The Language of the
Night</cite>)<p>

Tom Yates is asking fans to censor their actions in pursuit of the
vague aim of improving the public image of sf.<p>

And don't forget that sf (and indeed all imaginative fiction)
<em>is</em> literature for children of all ages.  It demands of the
reader the child's ability to suspend disbelief, and affirms the value
of `childish' make&#173;believe as a valid way to consider `adult'
issues.<p>

So I say, show us we're wrong!  Organise a convention, or a workshop,
at which literate and mature adults will show the world that sf is a
literary force to be reckoned with, and I for one will certainly
attend.  But let us have our fun!<p>



<hr><a name="exchairb"><h2>The Ex&#173;Chairbeing's Address</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

Things were not going well.  I ordered a dry martini, but the thing
used too much vermouth, as usual.  I shifted my weight uneasily from
foot to foot as I engaged in nervous conversation with my guests.
<em>My</em> guests?  Not for much longer.  Just one more to arrive and
our circle would be complete.<p>

The sun had just set and I gave a mental order to start a storm
brewing.  Should I release the bats?  They dislike storms but look so
pretty in the twilight.  The old place needed something alive in it.
The mortar was crumbling and it would soon be eroded entirely by
unnatural winds and malevolent forces.<p>

My final guest arrived, his cloak swirling around his imposing frame
as he stepped in from nowhere.  "I didn't realise that we were
dressing for dinner", he stated as he changed, mid&#173;step.  Another
sign of their uncertainty of what would occur. Even they could not
foretell everything.<p>

An imp announced dinner and we moved through.  I decided to save my
announcement until after the roast hobbit so that it would not spoil
their meal and so that my storm could mature for full dramatic effect.
By the time the elf ice&#173;cream was served, lightning was striking
every few seconds.<p>

"Gentlemen", I said in a deep, masterful voice, "You wonder why you
are here tonight."  Thunder boomed.  "It is because I am about to
undertake a journey into another world and so I must leave you."  A
small gasp escaped one as they struggled to keep control.  I
smiled.<p>

"But where will you go?", asked the tall, redheaded outlander beside
me.<p>

"I don't know where, Wizard Burnhead, but in my absence I give to you
mastery over all things if you will have it, for you have been a loyal
follower, if a little weird at times.  Most times, actually."<p>

"But when will you go?", asked the slender dandy beside him.<p>

"Immediately, Wizard Puck, and you I charge with keeping our raw magic
reserves safe, as you have always done, for you have been a loyal
follower, if somewhat of a character."<p>

"But what compels you to go?", asked the dark silent man across from
me.<p>

"Partly my will, Wizard Tome.  I charge you with holding raffles, for
you have always been a loyal follower, if a little violent."<p>

"But what else compels you?", asked the spaced out looking man next to
him.<p>

"Powers beyond my control, Wizard Merrymouth.  I ask you to promote
our order so that it does not die out, for you have been a loyal
follower, if a bit drunk occasionally."<p>

"But will you return?", asked the quizzical looking man to my
right.<p>

"Maybe for coffee, Wizard Reams, and to you I give my words, for you
have been a loyal follower, if a little quirky at times."<p>

"But what's going on?", asked the half&#173;Welshman beside me.<p>

"A philosophical question, Arch Wizard Water.  To you I give nothing,
for you have given me everything that I have, even if you do make bad
puns all the time.  Now stop asking stupid questions and..."<p>

I knew that my time to go had come and I faded away, passing on, only
to...<p>



<hr><a name="newsgare"><h2>News</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Yes, the sad news is that our beloved Chairbeing, Barry Traish, is
leaving Cambridge and will be furthering his studies in Philosophy at
Leeds University.  Due to his rather sudden departure, John Burnham
(previously Secretary) has agreed to take over as Chairman pro tem
until the by&#173;election to elect the new Chairbeing takes place.
If <em>you</em> want to take this opportunity to become CUSFS
Chairbeing, we will be very grateful if you would contact any of the
committee.  Details of the by&#173;election will be in your missives.

<h3>Speaker Meetings</h3>

Anne McCaffrey, who needs no introduction from me, and David Wingrove,
co&#173;author of <cite>Trillion Year Spree</cite> with Brian Aldiss
and author of the bestselling <cite>Chung Kuo</cite>, have said they
will speak to the society this term.  Look out for the details in your
missives.

<h3>Discussions this term</h3>

With Stephen Donaldson (14th October) it is not difficult to know what
to read.  His major work is the six&#173;volume fantasy epic <cite>The
Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</cite> (opening with <cite>Lord Foul's
Bane</cite>) concerning the introspective adventures of the eponymous
(and leprous) hero.  The work has been much criticised for its
ridiculously verbose and hysterical style, and praised for its
powerfully effective (if inexpertly handled by the inexperienced
writer) emotional power.  His more recent work, the two&#173;volume
fantasy <cite>Mordant's Need</cite>, is calmer and better written, but
without the dramatic power of his first series.  He promises a
forthcoming five&#173;volume sf series starting with <cite>The Gap
Into Conflict: The Real Story</cite> and claims it's "the nastiest,
fiercest thing I have ever tackled."  (Gareth Rees)<p>

Stephen Donaldson devoted ten years of his life to <cite>The
Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</cite>, but it was rejected by 47
publishers before hitting the bestseller lists.  Why the rejections?
Because it is the story of a guilt&#173;ridden leper who must save
`The Land' but cannot even help himself?  Partly.  And because of
Donaldson's overwhelming vocabulary and rigorous attention to detail
and description.  But every word exudes power.  <cite>The Second
Chronicles</cite> are largely similar to the first, but for the
introduction of a female protagonist, who makes Covenant seem
forgotten at times.  <cite>The One Tree</cite> stands apart from the
series in that Thomas Covenant leaves the Land and Donaldson's style
abruptly changes.  Discuss the differences yourselves.  <cite>Thomas
Covenant</cite> is said to be `comparable to Tolkien at his best', but
what blurb misses that?  Here however, such a comparison is
worthwhile: the detail, size, popularity, structure, plot elements...
<cite>Gildenfire</cite> is 90 pages which were cut from the first
<cite>Chronicles</cite>, but is barely worth mentioning or reading.
<cite>Mordant's Need</cite> begins similarly to <cite>Covenant</cite>:
the protagonist enters a fantasy world with unknown powers and which
may be a dream, but soon develops into a web of intrigue and deceit
which put it on the bestseller lists.  <cite>Daughter of Regals</cite>
is Donaldson's short story collection, which I personally find too
predictable, but it seems popular with others.  (Barry Traish)<p>

Iain Banks (28th October) spent some time writing around the fringes
of sf, producing a number of mainstream novels using the techniques of
horror, fantasy and sf, before coming out of the closet with his grand
space opera <cite>Consider Phlebas</cite>.  He has continued to mix
the genres: his mainstream books are <cite>The Wasp Factory</cite>,
<cite>Walking on Glass</cite>, <cite>The Bridge</cite>, <cite>Espedair
Street</cite> and <cite>Canal Dreams</cite>, and his sf trilogy
comprises <cite>Consider Phlebas</cite> plus <cite>The Player of
Games</cite> and <cite>the Use of Weapons</cite>.  (Gareth Rees)<p>

Gene Wolfe (11th November) has, over the past twenty years, written
literature in the form of science fiction: it is all worth
reading. However, since Wolfe has written many books, where should the
newcomer start?  One obvious choice is to start at the beginning in
which case you should read <cite>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</cite>
which dates back to 1972.  Others might wish to start with the best
known work which is <cite>The Book of the New Sun</cite> (a tetralogy
consisting of <cite>The Shadow of the Torturer</cite>, <cite>The Claw
of the Conciliator</cite>, <cite>The Sword of the Lictor</cite> and
<cite>The Citadel of the Autarch</cite>).  Finally, the cautious could
sample the short stories: I recommend <cite>The Island of Doctor
Death</cite>.  It is hard to know what to say about Wolfe in general
save that he enjoys playing games with the reader: do not trust your
narrator.  Cave Canem.  (Matthew Freestone)<p>

C. J. Cherryh (25th November) is perhaps the best writer of straight
sf writing today.  Her concerns are vast: she explores what makes
people truly human, the points of similarity between differing (and
often warring) peoples through which their conflicts can be resolved,
the effects of war on soldiers and victims, and always comes back to
her central theme: what happens to people when they face the
archetypal Other, something truly alien, something they can't speak to
or understand?  Her best books are the Hugo&#173;winning
<cite>Downbelow Station</cite> and <cite>Cyteen</cite>, plus
<cite>Cuckoo's Egg</cite>, <cite>Voyager in Night</cite>, <cite>Forty
Thousand in Gehenna</cite>, <cite>Rimrunners</cite>, <cite>The Pride
of Chanur</cite> and <cite>The Paladin</cite>.  (Gareth Rees)<p>

The venues for the discussions will be announced in your missives.<p>




<hr><a name="totalimm"><h2>The Total Immersion Game</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

In the streets of the city, I passed stalls selling black market
software, cheap computer chips, sushi in the rain.  Out of principle,
I avoided the pair of armed cops threading through the dense crowd; I
hadn't done anything illegal of late, but it never hurt.  Ignoring a
couple of girls with their pimp, I ducked into the smoky basement and
pushed past the regular customers, heading for the door at the back.
The guard there knew me, and let me into the back room where they kept
the illegal TIG machines.<p>

I wandered past a row of more recent games: I could try to stay alive
in court intrigue with "Courtiers and Kings", play n&#173;dimensional
chess in "Chessmaster", or defeat the enemy in "Spacewar".  The last
interested me; as I passed through the hallucinogen field, the view of
a deep&#173;space battle from the commander's bridge sprang up around
me.  What drew me was not the three&#173;dee battle itself, but the
technology used for advertising.  This was new, maybe a couple of
months; it must have cost the Limey a fortune on the black market.  No
wonder it cost so much a minute I thought, as I saw the price label.
I passed it by; I couldn't afford it, and the game I lived for was
sitting in the far corner, gathering dust.<p>

A dirty holo advertised "Mazes and Magic".  A grim, grimy stone
passageway stretched into the distance, several branches jutting off
at random.  At the end of the corridor, blocking the daylight, was a
dark dragon.  If I shifted my head from side to side, I could just
make out the glint of jewels round a crumbling corner.  This game was
my purpose in life; I needed it like I needed the air about me, and as
I sat down connecting the trodes I knew that I would, for a time,
forget reality in the complexities of the game...<p>

I looked about me and saw a forest clearing, dimly lit from somewhere
above.  Before me was a large cardboard box labelled "This Way Up",
with an arrow pointing toward the pale green sky.  This is pretty good
advice, mind you.  The rule book (to be found in my back pocket) said
that to win, I had to find Heaven, which was above all else; hence my
aim was to go upwards when I could.  I had found (in previous
incarnations) that climbing the trees, while affording me a better
view of my surroundings, didn't lead there.<p>

I knew that I lived in a vast forest, broken by various clearings and
a huge chasm that stretched as far as I could see in either direction.
Above me, the sky was divided into regular segments by fine lines of
darker green, and the peculiar light came from all directions.  If I
examined it from tree&#173;top, I would see half an enormous
icosahedron.<p>

Knowing my way about the forest, I set off at once down a narrow
forest path set in the trees on one side of the clearing (I had no
compass, and so no idea which direction this was).  Since visibility
was cut down to about 10 feet, there was no warning of the small
clearing containing a boulder partially buried in the grass.  There
was a white sword sheathed in the boulder to the hilt.  I had tried
before to remove the sword, but I knew that no amount of leverage
would pry it out, so I sat down quietly to wait, leaning on the
boulder.<p>

Presently, a knight in white enamelled armour stepped from the trees
saying, "May I lend you a hand?"  Without letting him touch the sword,
I vigorously shook the proffered gauntlet, which came off in my grasp
revealing nothing but air beneath.  Slipping it on, I easily removed
the sword, and as I courteously gave back the gauntlet, the armour
crumbled to dust at my feet.<p>

At the next clearing was a slender princess, dressed all in white and
wearing a white circlet at her brow.  She was standing at an artist's
easel, painting the clearing.  Before she could paint me into the
picture, I stepped up to her, and kissed her on the lips.  She
immediately turned into a bright green frog and hopped away into the
bushes, circlet perched precariously on top of her head.<p>

I examined the canvas.  The most obvious difference was that in the
picture, there was a white coronet on the ground in the middle of the
clearing.  So, taking with me the paints and the brush, I stepped into
the picture and found myself in a clearing similar to the one I had
just left.  Sure enough, there in the grass was the white coronet,
which I picked up and put on.  The exits had not been drawn (being
behind the princess as she painted), and the canvas on the easel was
blank.  So using the last of the paint, I set to work and stepped back
through the picture.<p>

Back in the original clearing, the princess (now returned to her true
form) was waiting beside the now blank canvas.  Continuing down the
path, we came to a huge chasm, stretching before us with no way across
or down.  On the far side was a beautiful white marble palace,
abounding with spires and minarets.  Just below was a small wooden
jetty hanging over the drop, and at a similar jetty on the far side
was a skeletal ferry&#173;man in his boat.  Seeing the coronet and
sword, he came to take us across to the far side, the pole making no
sound at all as we moved through the air; I had learned from
experience not to look over the side of the boat.<p>

When we reached the palace, I strode through the palace gates as if I
owned them, which indeed I did.  Laid out before us in the throne room
was a chessboard, ready to play with the White King and Queen missing.
My pages and courtiers filled out the nearest two rows in their proper
places, and the Queen and I stepped onto our squares immediately.
Since it was my turn to move, I called a challenge to the Red King,
that we should meet in the centre and duel; I was not certain of my
ability to win at chess, and I wanted to get past this scene
quickly.<p>

We met and duelled.  I quickly beat the Red King, running him through
the heart.  He vanished on hitting the floor, and the Red Queen went
green with anger.  Raising her arms above her head, she chanted in a
loud voice, on which the castle fell down about me.<p>

After all the noise had gone, I found myself at the edge of the chasm;
of the castle or the ferry there were no trace.  The other players
(both Queens included) had vanished, leaving nothing but a small piece
of paper in the grass.  It said "XYLOPHONE" in neat printed capitals.
Pocketing this, I started off down the path ahead of me, back into the
forest.<p>

Soon, the path forked.  At the junction stood a wooden signpost,
pointing to left and right with the words "Hell" and "Paradise"
respectively.  As I read, a dwarf holding a blood&#173;stained
battleaxe jumped out of the bushes behind me, and said, "Shall you
take the left path or the right?  Choose quickly between them, or I
will chop off your head."<p>

I had been here before.  I knew that the paths did indeed go where the
signpost said.  Hell I didn't want to see again for a while, and
Paradise wasn't all you might hope for, either.  Nice place, but no
escape.  I had tried dodging past the dwarf or waiting where I was,
but the axe met its thirst regardless.<p>

The correct action was to follow the dwarf's advice, and go between
the paths.  So I parted the undergrowth behind the signpost, and found
a carefully hidden door in the large tree that stood there.  Ascending
the staircase behind this, I soon came to the cluttered wizard's
laboratory.  There was a diagram on the floor, and lots of items on
the benches.  If I stayed here too long, the wizard would find and
kill me, so I quickly selected a claw&#173;shaped jewel clasp and a
dull brown bean from the benches and stepped onto the diagram saying
"Xylophone!"<p>

I found myself in a baking desert under a washed out blue sky.  On the
cracked ground was a large emerald, carefully cut into the shape of an
icosahedron; faint dark shapes could barely be made out in its depths.
A dim green smoke was dissipating slowly in the lifeless desert air.
Immediately I set the stone in the clasp that I had taken, so the
wizard could not emerge to kill me.<p>

About twenty feet above me was a snake's tail stretching down out of
the sky, and thirty feet away on the perfectly flat surface was a
small round oasis, surrounded by low bushes.  Nothing else obscured
the view, flat and featureless to the horizon, and a great thirst
filled me.  I had found previously that running toward the oasis,
however fast, would send it scurrying away, always staying more than
thirty feet away.  With practice, I had managed to herd it beneath the
snake, so I could throw the bean into the still water.  When this time
the bean sprouted a tall stalk, I chased the water away, and climbed
up to the snake.  I found that the sky was only ten feet above the end
of the snake; as I climbed into darkness, the snake became a strong
rope, which I continued climbing.<p>

The first of my senses to be assailed was hearing, as a crowded,
complex melody of sounds (pierced by that of a flute) wafted from
above.  Then came smell, with the rich odour of people about their
daily business.  At last, light came back as I emerged from a large
basket into a busy market.  I was clinging onto the end of a rope,
which was swaying back and forth to the sound of a flute.  Just behind
me was a man seated on the ground, playing a drowsy tune on his
instrument.  He didn't look at all surprised that I had appeared from
his basket, and a richly dressed merchant threw me a coin for the
trick.<p>

I recognised the bustling Fountain Square, whose Escher&#173;like
buildings and alleys I knew well.  In the centre was a stone
construction, clearly labelled "The Fountain of Rubies".  It
continually threw sparkling red jewels into the air, which reflected
the bright sunlight in a delightful parody of water; I had already
discovered in trying to catch one that they had razor&#173;sharp
edges. Near the fountain was a large stone signpost, with arrows in
all directions, each saying "Fountain Square".  On one side of the
square was a red sandstone palace with firmly locked doors, and on the
opposite side a grand temple.<p>

Sitting outside one of the taverns lining the square, I noticed my
guardian angel, a flash of white.  I tried threading through the
market toward him, but lost sight of him, and when I got there, he was
where I had just come from, happily talking to the musician.  The last
time I was here, I had given my coin to a convenient beggar, who had
immediately taken it into the temple.  This time I thought, I would do
this myself.  The temple was spacious and airy inside; the cool marble
walls seemed to absorb the day's noise and heat into themselves,
creating a calm cool pool of quiet.  A priest came bustling up to me,
slippered feet sometimes showing from his robes like tentative snakes.
I put the coin into his readily proffered collecting box, and was
given a crude wooden cross in return.<p>

Having done this, I left the temple for the fountain in the square.
On a whim, I had once thrown my emerald into the quiescent pool of
rubies, to find that all became green (though the carved lettering in
the fountain side remained as it was).  Now as then, the palace doors
swung open and I entered its vast stone halls.  The Red Queen stood at
the top of the main stairs, her sea&#173;green skin beautifully set
off by a shimmering emerald dress, and silver jewellery at wrist,
throat and brow.  Still furious with me, she chased me into the
dungeons, and down a bottomless pit to Hell.<p>

Hell was where you went when you died in the world above.  There was
only one rule: death was permanent; if they killed you here, you had
to start over.  I had never survived being in Hell; I'd always come to
some grisly end at the hand of a demon.  So I brandished my cross at
those approaching, who backed away in time for my guardian angel to
arrive and take me to Fountain Square.  If you've never flown by
angel, I won't try to describe it; you'll have to play the game
yourself.  The only adjective I can use is "intoxicating".<p>

When I entered the palace again, the Red Queen was not there to greet
me, so I climbed every staircase I could find; soon, I was ascending
the tallest tower of the castle for the first time ever.  There were
no windows and after a time, I emerged from a small stone building on
a barren hilltop.  It was night, but there were no stars.  The
surrounding hills were indistinct, and became blurred if I looked at
them closely.  A chill wind started up from nowhere; it quickly became
a chilling death&#173;scream, and a large eagle fell on me.<p>

In Hell, I found I no longer had the cross, and so no protection
against demons.  My personal tormentor came to me and said cheerfully,
"You lose...  again."  When it had fastened chains at wrist and ankle,
I knew again that I had always been chained, for a fraction of
forever.  When it saw that I knew every painful detail, it put it's
chill hand on my brow and tortured my mind again, with visions of
freedom...<p>

I looked about me and saw a forest clearing, dimly lit from somewhere
above.  Before me was a large cardboard box labelled "This Way Up",
with an arrow pointing toward the pale green sky.  I had to rest
before again trying to win.  I needed the game like a drug, so badly
that my hands were shaking as I opened the box and uncovered the TIG
machine, the lettering "Streets of the City" neatly engraved into the
side.  As I sat down connecting the trodes I knew that I would, for a
time, forget reality in the complexities of the game...<p>

I paid the bill and stumbled out of the basement into the clammy night
air, vague memories of the game occasionally flooding my head and
making me wonder, not for the first time, whether reality lay in
"Mazes and Magic", "Streets of the City", or something entirely
different.<p>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

<h3>A Critical Evaluation</h3>

"Ah! No!" you cry, "Not Asimov!"  But yes, Asimov it is, the
acknowledged Grand Master of the genre, writer of well over 400 books,
editorial director of the hugely successful (and very good)
<cite>Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</cite>, opinionated
egotist, winner of many Hugo and Nebula awards and one of the most
prolific authors in the world.  Can I tackle this literary giant
without seriously damaging my credibility?  I doubt it, but I shall
try all the same, for there is material not without worth in the
Asimov opus.  Too many people express a knee&#173;jerk hostile
reaction to Asimov while cheerfully admitting to liking material that
is far worse (I stoop to mention Norman, Howard, Smith, Anthony,
Heinlein, Eddings) and it is far too easy to criticise Asimov without
any real understanding of what he has written.  So here goes...

<h3>The Early Asimov</h3>

As is by now well known, Asimov burst onto the sf scene in July 1939
to very little notice with the appearance of `Trends' in
<cite>Astounding SF</cite>.  ('Marooned Off Vesta' and `The Weapon Too
Dreadful to Use' were earlier, but much less interesting).  It is easy
to see why there was little interest: Asimov was not a pulp writer.
He had no muscled heros blasting off to adventure on distant planets,
no battles with fearsome bug&#173;eyed aliens or evil pirates, no
beautiful damsels to be rescued at the last minute.  His stories
consisted in the main of dry scientists talking to each other, with
not a raygun in sight.  His concerns were with the grand sweep of
history and knowledge rather than individual heroics.  `Trends' deals
with popular opposition to the first space flight, which is replaced,
as the inevitable pendulum of history swings back again, with popular
acclaim by the end of the story.  There is no place here for pulp
adventure - the man who heroically undertakes the first moon flight is
in the end seen as fundamentally unimportant in the wider scheme of
history.<p>

Certainly some of Asimov's best work has been in this vein, with the
epic `Foundation' trilogy as one of his pinnacles of achievement.
Here the forces of historical determinism are brought to bear on a
grand galactic scale.  The Foundation prevails, not because of the
individual heroics of its leaders, but because it is socially and
economically determined that it will do so.<p>

Of course, this is not the whole story.  Asimov's writing skill was
simply not up to the task of writing 220,000 words of historical
dialectics <em>and</em> making it interesting.  So, in a rare flash of
creative genius, he introduced a major villain ('The Mule'), and a
hero to fight him, whose battle takes up the latter
one&#173;and&#173;a-half books of the trilogy.  But these characters
are no standard villains or heros.  The Mule, whose massive mental
powers cause the historical impetus which has protected the Foundation
to break down, is portrayed in a much more sympathetic light than
might be expected.  Although he is set up against the Foundation, he
is seen not so much as a villain, but rather as an equal adversary.
Asimov's historical viewpoint sees that moral judgements are important
only in the short&#173;term; in the long&#173;term, nations, empires
and leaders will be judged on their success or failure rather than
their personality.  The hero is equally unusual.  Preem Palver is a
quiet, somewhat fatherly figure who defeats the Mule through clever
strategy rather than force or weaponry.<p>

The success of the `Foundation' trilogy can be further emphasised by
noting that Asimov's few ventures into the pulp&#173;adventure class
of story have been uniformly dreadful - I can only suggest you read
`Ring Around the Sun', `The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use', `Black Friar
of the Flame' or - and even the title is truly awful -
`Half&#173;Breeds on Venus'.<p>

However, if Asimov fares well as an innovator, against a background of
traditional action&#173;adventure sf, he fares less well on other
counts.<p>

His characterisation is very poor, to say the least (but he was
intelligent enough to choose a format in which this matters less).
How many people can you name from early (or indeed any) Asimov
stories?  I certainly had to look up all the names I've mentioned in
this essay.  His scientist characters are concerned only with science,
and all seem to be cut from the same piece of cardboard.  His
adventuring heros are pale shadows of the heros we find in the works
of his contemporaries.  Consider the following:

<blockquote>Steeden noted the kid's sparkling eyes, and addressed
himself to the little fellow.  "I was with Peewee Wilson when it
happened - you've heard of Peewee Wilson, haven't you?"

"Oh, yes," Stanley's eyes fairly exuded hero&#173;worship.  "I've read
books about him.  He was the greatest spacer there ever was."<p>

"You bet all the radium on Titan he was, kid.  He wasn't any taller
than you, and didn't scale much more than a hundred pounds, but he was
worth five times his weight in Venusians Devils in any fight.  And me
and him were just like that.  He never went anyplace but what I was
with him.  When the going was toughest it was always me that he turned
to."</blockquote>

('The Callistan Menace')<p>

Women, though (when they appear - and I think it would be fair to say
that they are rare in Asimov's work due to genre constraints and his
uncertainty of how to deal with them rather than because of any
misogynistic attitude) are portrayed rather better than average -
certainly Arkady Darrell in <cite>Second Foundation</cite> is a rather
engaging and active heroine (although lacking depth, like all Asimov
characters).  More on characterisation later.<p>

Asimov's writing is another weak point.  He has often championed the
virtues of simple and straightforward prose:

<blockquote>It seems there are two ways of writing fiction.<p>

In one way you pay more attention to the language itself than to the
events you are describing.  You are anxious to write colourfully, to
paint a picture of the setting or the background of the events. ...<p>

In the other kind, words and phrases are chosen not for their
freshness or novelty, or for their unexpected ability to evoke a mood,
but simply for their ability to describe what is going on without
themselves getting in the way.  Everything is subordinated to
clarity.</blockquote>

('The Mosaic and the Plate Glass')<p>

It seems that Asimov has no real comprehension of why `good writing'
is good - or perhaps he is simply making excuses, for his writing is
just not capable of conveying significant details of character or
scenery.  In the course of 26 novels (as I write) and hundreds of
short stories, there are few memorable landscapes or fascinating
people to be found.  For instance, her is the longest passage of
description that I could find after looking through three `Space
Ranger' novels that should have been filled with marvellous vistas of
the solar system:

<blockquote>Nothing could be seen of the planet's surface.  No
continents showed, no oceans, no deserts or mountains, no green
valleys.  Whiteness, only brilliant whiteness, interspersed with
shifting lines of grey.<p>

The whiteness was the turbulent cloud layer that hovered eternally
over all of Venus, and the grey lines marked the boundaries where
cloud masses met and clashed.  Vapour moved downward at the
boundaries, and below those grey lines, on Venus's invisible surface,
it rained.</blockquote>

(<cite>Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus</cite>)

This description is rare (for Asimov) in its (comparative) length and
elegance, but is still clinical and functional.  It is apparent that
Asimov is simply not concerned with emotional reactions to landscape,
nor with people for their own sake.  As Asimov might have said,
everything is subordinated to the plot.<p>

But Asimov can't have become as successful as he has if his writing is
<em>all</em> bad.  So what are his good points?  Well, the writing's
simplicity makes his stories very slick - there is little that's
easier to read (or easier to forget).<p>

Secondly, Asimov's plots are well&#173;constructed - you'll find few
loose ends, dei ex machina, or any of the other dodgy plot
constructions that sf authors are prone to.  Certainly in his best
work the conclusion arises naturally from what has gone before, and
such careful plotting is at its best in the mysteries that Asimov
occasionally writes so well.<p>

Thirdly, the science is well done.  Asimov knows what materials are
magnetic, how far apart the planets are, what the speed of light is,
what kinds of life might be possible.  Asimov also has a good sense of
when to wave the hands, spout some nonsense and get on with the plot.
Asimov's `positronic robots' may have been ridiculed by Dave Langford
for the dangerous radiation that would be produced by the annihilation
of positrons, but to Asimov (and any discerning reader), `positronic'
was only a convenient label so that he could avoid having to justify
their operation, but instead concentrate on the themes that would
result from humans dealing with purely logical beings.<p>

However - in recent years Asimov has lost his touch.  I refer in
particular to <cite>Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain</cite>
(1987).  In the original novel (1966), Asimov merely comments that the
miniaturisation of the submarine is achieved by making the atoms
smaller, and leaves it at that.  However, in the sequel, he wastes
page after page attempting to justify this patent impossibility by
making his characters discuss at tedious length the implications of
reducing Planck's constant:

<blockquote>"Planck's constant decreases inside the miniaturisation
field - that is the essence of miniaturisation.  The wavelengths, in
shrinking, maintain their relationship to the shrunken Planck's
constant and do not gain in energy.  An analogous case is that of the
atoms.  They also shrink. ...  The strong interaction and the
electromagnetic interaction come under the umbrella of the quantum
theory.  They depend on Planck's constant.  As for gravitation?
Despite two centuries of effort, that has never been quantized.
Frankly, I think the gravitational change with miniaturisation is
evidence enough that gravitation cannot be quantized; that it is
fundamentally non&#173;quantum in nature."</blockquote>

<h3>The Caves of Steel</h3>

Between 1950 and 1958 Asimov wrote sixteen novels (including the three
`Foundation' books), about which not very much else can be said,
except to note that, in general, they are readable but
unexceptional.<p>

The outstanding novel from this period is the sf mystery <cite>The
Caves of Steel</cite>, not so much for its quality as a mystery
(though it's as good as any Christie) but for the intriguing social
observation.  The story of this novel is one of a collision of two
vastly different cultures.  Earth is poor, crowded, seriously
overpopulated, insular and xenophobic, suspicious of new technologies
(such as robots).  The people live in dark, brooding warrens known as
Cities (with the capital), scared of the outside.<p>

`Spacers' are humans who left the Earth to set up colonies in space.
They lay claim to fifty worlds, are extremely rich, have virtually
unlimited resources, controlled populations, and a much higher level
of technology and standard of living than Earth, both based heavily
upon robot labour.  They are worried about Earth's vast population, to
the extent of blockading the Earth from space, shutting them into
their world in the fear that if Earth were to be allowed to relieve
its overcrowding by colonisation, the Spacers would be completely
overwhelmed.  And one of their prominent scientists has been murdered
on Earth.<p>

Earth's representative in this meeting of cultures is a young
policeman, Elijah Bayley; the spacer representative is an android
('humaniform robot') called Daneel Olivaw; and it is the developing
relationship between these two unlikely emissaries that makes
<cite>The Caves of Steel</cite> so good.  Bayley learns to overcome
his fear of robots and learns the values of an outward- and
forward&#173;looking culture, while Daneel comes to respect the wisdom
of the Earthman, and through him, the Spacers are gradually persuaded
away from their view of the Terrans as ignorant and unwashed
masses.<p>

In my opinion, <cite>The Caves of Steel</cite> is Asimov's best novel
- and if you read only one Asimov, this should be it.<p>

However, as the `Robots' series of novels continues, the focus becomes
(at least to my mind) quite strange.  Asimov continues to compare the
Earth and Spacer cultures through the Bayley&#173;Olivaw relationship.
However, it becomes apparent that Asimov strongly favours the Earth
society, despite all its shortcomings.  Indeed it becomes clear that
he never intended the world of <cite>The Caves of Steel</cite> to be a
dystopia:

<blockquote>I wrote a novel in 1953 which pictured a world in which
everyone lived in underground cities, comfortably excluded from the
open air.<p>

People would say, "How could you imagine such a nightmarish
situation?"<p>

And I would answer in astonishment, "What nightmarish
situation?"</blockquote>

(introduction to `It's such a beautiful day')<p>

Asimov admires the society of Earth for its vivacity, its fecundity,
emotionality and self&#173;reliance, and dislikes the Spacer societies
for their low population, stability (due to their extended lifetimes)
and reliance on robots.  I found myself severely disappointed with
Asimov's conclusions in <cite>Robots and Empire</cite>, but perhaps
your prejudices are not the same as mine - read the series and find
out!

<h3>The Gods Themselves</h3>

Between 1958 (<cite>The Death Dealers</cite>) and 1982
(<cite>Foundation's Edge</cite>), Asimov wrote only one sf original
novel, <cite>The Gods Themselves</cite> (1972) and <em>that</em> was
unintentional (it was an intended novella that grew to
novel&#173;length) - yet produced 234 books.  How is this?<p>

Well, in order to increase his apparent profligacy, Asimov likes to
credit himself with `authorship' of the sf collections he collaborates
in editing (usually with Martin Greenberg, Joseph Olander or Charles
Waugh).  This accounts for 42 of the 234.  Most of the remainder are
the science popularisations that dominate any bibliography of Asimov's
work.  I won't comment much on these (since my brief is Asimov's sf)
except to note that much of his vast science output comes from
covering the same ground many times.  Thus we have <cite>The Solar
System</cite>, <cite>The Kingdom of the Sun</cite>, <cite>The
Sun</cite>, <cite>The Sun Shines Bright</cite>, <cite>What Makes the
Sun Shine?</cite>, <cite>The Universe</cite>, <cite>To the Ends of the
Universe</cite>, <cite>How Did We Find Out About the Universe?</cite>,
<cite>Mars</cite>, <cite>Mars, the Red Planet</cite> and articles like
`The Olympian Snows' about Mars (and many more that I didn't look up).
He also has a tendency to go for the complete historical background
wherever possible - an article on Mars <em>must</em> start with the
ancient Romans and the source of the planet's name, and from there to
Schiaparelli's `canali' and so on.<p>

But I'm being a little unfair.  Asimov is writing on different aspects
of the same topic for different publishers and different audiences.
And certainly providing easy&#173;to&#173;understand science
popularisations for the American public can be no bad thing.  But I
digress.<p>

Although this period produced virtually no novels, it did produce some
of Asimov's best short fiction.  Perhaps because he was writing so
little sf, the fiction he did write was of a much higher quality.  The
stories to read from this period are both weepies.  In `The
Bicentennial Man', a robot can only become human by accepting
mortality, while in `The Ugly Little Boy' a Neanderthal boy is seen
purely as experimental fodder by the scientists who brought him
forward from the past, but as a person by the young woman charged with
looking after him.<p>

But what of <cite>The Gods Themselves</cite>?  Well, to me, the novel
is miraculously balanced between his early (pre&#173;1960) and late
(post&#173;1980) periods of writing.  The first of the book's three
sections is a colourless drama which might be mistaken for any of his
early novels, while the third section is the same sort of wordy,
plotless tourist&#173;trip story that was to ruin most of his later
writing.<p>

But sandwiched between these two, oh joy!  Asimov gives us a momentary
look into the lives of one of his very rare alien races - and this
time, extremely well done.  This section follows the lives of three
members of this triple&#173;sexed species as they go through their
biological cycle (producing three children) and at the same time
attempt to penetrate the web of secrecy thrown up around contact with
the humans we met in part 1.  If at times the species' life&#173;cycle
seems unconvincing, you can forgive it for the sensitive portrayal of
the three&#173;way relationship and the way the course of the
relationship is knitted into the book's plot.  Asimov has never
written so well, before or since.

<h3>Prelude to Robots and Foundation</h3>

Now the story gets rather sad, because to the best of my knowledge
Asimov has written no fiction worth reading for nearly 15 years.  His
short work has been caught up in the type of tedious, repetitive
formula&#173;series that I criticised in my review of
<cite>Azazel</cite> in <cite>Trying to Behave
Anachronistically</cite>, and he has been rehashing old glories and
contributing nothing new in his recent `Foundation' and `Robot' novels
- yet people buy them, they become bestsellers, and <cite>Foundation's
Edge</cite> even won a Hugo award.<p>

The problem with the recent `Foundation' novels is that each volume
has to promise greater revelations than the last: who is really
running the galaxy?  It's the Foundation.  No, it's the Second
Foundation.  No, it's actually the secret planet of superbeings, Gaea!
No, it's <em>actually</em> a twenty&#173;thousand&#173;year old
telepathic robot you might recall from an earlier Asimov novel - until
Golan Trevise's dull and pointless ramblings across the galaxy become
unbearable even to Asimov.<p>

<cite>Foundation and Earth</cite> is nothing but a feeble attempt to
tie together sections of a future history that had stood alone quite
happily, while <cite>Prelude to Foundation</cite> portrays the
distinguished mathematician Hari Seldon as a martial&#173;arts
vigilante in one of the most embarrassing disasters of a novel it has
ever been my misfortune to read.<p>

In <cite>Robots and Empire</cite>, the previously believable robot
Daneel Olivaw discovers a new law of robotics which translates as `the
ends justify the means' and promptly condemns the entire population of
Earth to death by radiation poisoning so that humanity will spread to
the stars, and then goes off to become the superbeing we met in
<cite>Foundation and Earth</cite>.<p>

I've heard that his latest, <cite>Nemesis</cite> (did I mention Agatha
Christie somewhere before?) is an original novel, but even I have lost
the courage to lift it down from the shelf in my local library...

<h3>The End of Eternity</h3>

So there you have it - Asimov's entire scientifictional output summed
up in four pages.<p>

Conclusions?  Well, there <em>is</em> some good material to be found
among Asimov's vast output - but there are much better authors to be
wasting your time reading.  Maybe I'll do an article on one of them
next issue...<p>



<hr><a name="anewcome"><h2>The Science Fiction Society</h2></a>

<h3>A Newcomer's Guide</h3>

If you're a new member, welcome to CUSFS (pronounced
"cuss&#173;fss"). CUSFS was founded in 1963 by internationally
renowned hack author, critic and <cite>Interzone</cite> columnist
Charles Platt (although he was then an undergraduate), before he was
thrown out of the university for failing his Part 1B exams.  In the
60s CUSFS was a serious literary society, and didn't reach its present
form until 1973, when it was reformed and the magazine was started.

<h3>Who we are</h3>

CUSFS is one of the more cosmopolitan societies in Cambridge, with an
astonishingly high number of graduates and `real&#173;world' members -
around 25% of members are no longer students at the university.  There
is therefore an opportunity to mix with a circle of people you might
not otherwise have a chance to meet.<p>

The ratio of men to women is about 3:1, which is not very good, but
that isn't really our fault - both Cambridge and sf are
male&#173;dominated institutions, and there's not a great deal we can
do about it, except to try to be as non&#173;sexist as we possibly
can.<p>

Of course, the best way to find out who we are is to come to the
Thursday evening meetings in New Hall bar (of which more below).

<h3>The Committee</h3>

The society is run by a committee of six, known variously as `The
Committee', `The Spanish Inquisition' and `The Mugs Who Didn't Say
No'. Mostly they are second years, due to a common Cambridge
misapprehension that second years have lots of spare time on their
hands.  The six posts are:<p>

<strong>Chairbeing</strong> This poor fool is responsible for the
running of the society, which invariably means all the dirty jobs that
no&#173;one else wants to do.<p>

<strong>Secretary</strong> Looks after the mail, the society records,
and arranges speaker meetings.<p>

<strong>Junior Treasurer</strong> Responsible for looking after the
money and preparing the accounts for our senior treasurer, Ruth
Williams.<p>

<strong>Membership Secretary</strong> Does lots of things - taking
memberships, keeping membership lists, distributing missives and {!}
looking after the society's computer resources.<p>

<strong>Librarian</strong> Takes care of the `Library of Babel' (of
which more below) and organises raffles.<p>

<strong>Magazine Editor</strong> This poor downtrodden wretch is given
the terrible burden of producing at least one issue of the magazine
each term.  Write something for the magazine, or at the very least
shed a tear of pity.<p>

The committee are elected in the Easter term, but it has been some
years now since there has been a contested election.

<h3>Vice&#173;Presidents</h3>

Every year, the society elects six honorary vice&#173;presidents in
perpetuity.  There are no restrictions on these vice&#173;presidents -
they need not be alive, real, or indeed people at all.  It is by now
<em>de rigeur</em> to elect fictional characters, abstract concepts,
lines of poetry and all manner of strange things.  {!}(Even bits of
computer programming).

<h3>The Constitution</h3>

The constitution has retained its current form since 1979, and is a
marvellous piece of socio&#173;psychological engineering.  It's just a
pity the jokes are so bad.  If you want to examine it, ask a committee
member for a copy.

<h3>What We Do</h3>

Expect the unexpected - there's a Christmas Party (in May, of course),
a Traditional Annual Dinner which we may be holding this year for the
first time, lots of video showings, trips to see plays and films, and
of course conventions.  Not to mention:

<h3>Thursday Meetings</h3>

The Thursday evening social meetings in New Hall bar are the hub of
CUSFS life around which all else revolves.  Enough said.

<h3>Discussions</h3>

These are the serious meetings of the society, held on alternate
Sunday evenings during term, at which the literary merits of the work
of sf authors are discussed.  This term we're discussing the works of
controversial author Stephen Donaldson, plus Iain Banks, Gene Wolfe
and C. J. Cherryh.

<h3>Speaker Meetings</h3>

On average, there is about one of these a term, usually on a Friday
evening, and they are very well&#173;attended.  Some surprisingly
well&#173;known authors have come to speak to us - we've heard talks
from Brian Aldiss, Alfred Bester, Terry Pratchett, Tanith Lee and many
others.<p>

This year, we hope to have David Wingrove, Anne McCaffrey and probably
Terry Pratchett.

<h3>The Library</h3>

The Library of Babel is the society's major asset, a collection of
over 2,500 books, consisting mostly (owing to financial restraints) of
second&#173;hand, remaindered and donated books and magazines.  The
Library is currently housed in the Reference Room in the Union Society
building (straight in, up the stairs, turn right, and the Reference
Room is on your left), and should be open between 2 and 4pm on Monday
to Saturday during term.  The library depends on volunteer
sublibrarians to spend a couple of hours on one afternoon a week in
the library to run it - we give a free years' membership to these
hardy souls.<p>

Unfortunately we will not have this ideal situation for long.  The
University will shortly cease to fund the Union Society (in March
1991), at which point the Union will no longer have any obligation to
the societies who use its facilities and will promptly kick them (and
us) out.<p>

The committee are frantically looking for somewhere to house the
library, and will be glad to hear of any useful ideas you may have.
Otherwise, the once&#173;proud library will be reduced to a vast pile
of cardboard boxes in the librarian's room.<p>

<h3>TTBA: the Magazine of the Cambridge University Science Fiction
Society</h3>

<cite>ttba</cite> has had a long and chequered history, but
generations of editors have persevered, and since its foundation in
1974, <cite>ttba</cite> has never failed to produce an issue each
term.  In the beginning, the magazine went by the name </cite>Title to
be Announced</cite>.  But by issue 13, the editor became bored, and
started to actually announce the title (starting with <cite>Tex,
Tardis and the Black Asteroid</cite>) and somehow, all the titles that
were announced had the same initials.  It has been traditional since
then for new editors to explain all this in the first issue of each
new year.<p>

Anyway, the best titles include:

<blockquote>Thatcher: the British Ayatollah<br>

Tolkien Trivialised by Animation<br>

Tanker Tows Britain Away<br>

The Triple&#173;Breasted Aardvark<br>

Transvestite Teddy Bears Anonymous<br>

Tiger, Tiger, Burning Abnormally<br></blockquote><br>

If you actually want to <em>read</em> any of these, there are three
places to look.  The <cite>ttba</cite> editor has a small collection -
I'll lend you copies or let you photocopy them.  There is a CUSFS
archive which is rather more complete - ask Paul Treadaway.  The
University Library also has a large collection, of which volumes 1-8
(1974-1981) may be found in the Rare Books Room under classmark
cam.a.21.9, and an incomplete set of volumes 8-17 (1981-1990) may be
found at the periodicals desk.<p>

<cite>ttba</cite> aims to provide an opportunity for all members to
get into print, and certainly the standards certainly aren't
prohibitatively high.  If you like writing, have a go - it's worth
it!<p>



<hr><a name="sffilesp"><h2>{!} The SF Filespace on Phoenix</h2></a>

<h3>John Meredith</h3>

A filespace named SF is held on the University Mainframe computer
(Phoenix), and since I quite often get asked "What's it for?", I shall
answer here.  The last time this happened was in the first TTBA that I
read, and the filespace has been re&#173;arranged since then for
technical reasons.<p>

Some of the files are concerned with the running of the society, and
are not readable by anyone (Access on a strictly "Need to Know" basis)
as the data contained therein is somewhat sensitive.  These include
the files <code>SF.CAT.LOST</code>, <code>SF.COMMTTEE</code>,
<code>SF.MEMBERS</code> and <code>SF.TAPEDICT</code><p>

The library catalogue (which is publicly readable) is held in
<code>SF.CAT</code>,<p>

An international bulletin board type file (read&#173;only, sadly) is
kept in <code>SF.MEMBERS.LOVERS</code> (rec.arts.sf&#173;lovers)<p>

Miscellaneous odd bits and pieces are held in
<code>SF.PUBLIC.TEXT</code>, including <code>MISSIVES</code>, the
infamous <code>DRINKS</code> list, a copy of the
<code>CONST</code>itution...<p>

<h3>{!} The CUSFS Zinque Section</h3>

To use the CUSFS Zinque section, you must first load the Zinque
library from its resting place using the command <code>%C
RPTB1.PUBLIC:ZINQUE</code> which will allow you to read and reply to
general zinque items.  To select the CUSFS section, you must enter
<code>ZSECTION CUSFS</code>.  To obtain a list of items, use
<code>ZINDEX</code>.  To read an item, use <code>ZREAD</code>.  The
command <code>ZRN</code> is also useful, as it produces an index in
last updated order.<p>

To reply to CUSFS section items, you must be related to the filespace
<code>SFMEM</code>.  To achieve this you must ask me to relate you, by
typing something like

<blockquote><code> %MAILNOTE JDM17 Please let me reply to Zinque.
</code></blockquote>

This allows the use of the <code>ZREPLY</code> command.<p>

More details of Zinque commands may be found by use of the
<code>ZHELP</code> command which is a part of the Zinque library.<p>



<hr><a name="examinat"><h2>The Examination</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

The preparations were complete.  One of the acolytes had lit the
incense candles, drawn the occult Symbols in chalk on the cool
flagstones, and laid out the traditional offering: a small ceremonial
dagger, a goblet of pale wine, a plain staff of ash, and a pile of
burnished golden coins (these at the cardinal points of the Circle, in
the prescribed manner).<p>

The Hall was lined on both sides by rows of seated Wizards come for
the Examination, their richly cowled, robed and slippered figures
ominous in the dense gloom: deep reds and purples lining heavy robes
of velvet, arcane symbols stitched in gold or silver to the hems; each
carrying some symbol of his station: a deeply carved and capped staff
here, a moist glistening jewel there; and perhaps some small familiar:
owl, cat, tortoise or toad, each serenely comfortable in its own
manner.<p>

Most richly dressed of all was the Examiner himself, standing before
the strange&#173;familiar Diagram: his long traditional robes of black
weighed down by jewels and brocade, his staff of office doubly
entwined by creatures of Light and Dark, and his silver coronet
holding back a fine black mane of well&#173;kept hair.  His features
were of indeterminate age in the semi&#173;dark.<p>

In open contrast, the young man kneeling at the diametrically opposed
point on the Circle; humble in dirty and begrimed rags as if carefully
groomed for the events ahead, as much as the waiting watchers on
either side.  His face and hands unwashed, and carrying the dust of
the street.  Under a ragged mop of dark hair, his eyes an unexpectedly
bright blue, shining with hope and dreams.<p>

An overloaded silence settled like so much smoke on this expectant
scene, as though it could be kept for posterity in some scholar's
archives; gathering time, like dust.  The Examiner's voice emerged
from the folds of his hood, quiet yet resounding in the minds of all
who listened, following the well&#173;known ritual ceremony.  "You
come before us to be Examined.  May the Hierarchy of Powers itself
take a hand in your Judgement."<p>

With these words, he rapped thrice on the floor with his staff, and
muttered the impressive, instantly forgotten Phrases of Invocation.
Thick smoke began to roll from the candles in their iron holders,
obscuring the Diagram from all.  It swirled mysteriously and
dissolved, revealing a tall blue scaled figure within; lightening
sparked between its horns, and dreadful was its Aspect.  A manic gleam
came into its eyes when it saw the pitiful wretch kneeling before it
with head bowed.<p>

As if on cue, the young man raised his head and stared the creature in
the eyes, trying to force it back to the Bottomless Pit by will power
alone.  The heroic struggle could be seen in the tense muscles of his
back, but finally the human's will broke before that fell gaze which
had defeated many a lesser creature of the Pit, and he begged the
Demon's forgiveness for daring to challenge its supremacy.<p>

The Examiner's gaze was almost kindly as he spoke the Words of
Banishment, and the Hall became suddenly more airy and spacious.  He
led the weeping failed candidate through the assembled pitying ranks
of Wizards toward the sunlight, now precious after that terrible
claustrophobia.  At the door, the young man turned and looked at the
expectant faces, their collective gaze upon him.  He came to some
final conclusion in his mind.<p>

"None of this means anything," he said thickly, the tears of shame and
need running down his face.  "All right, so I failed your test.
Nobody could have met that gaze, not even the Grand Vizier himself!
You are no better than common street magicians in your expensive robes
and cheap illusions; at least the jugglers and tricksters in the
markets make no pretence to higher things.  I denounce you one and
all."  With that, he turned on his heel and stalked proudly into the
world of reality.<p>

His speech had the most startling effect on the massed Wizards in the
Hall; the Examiner went hurrying after the young man, calling him
back, perhaps to greater shame and misery.  In his grief, he stumbled
back to the applauding crowd, now divesting themselves of their robes
and hoods, now putting away their implements.  The Examiner explained
profusely.<p>

"Well done, well done indeed; you saw through the play, as each man
before you has done in his time.  You have the insight and wisdom to
be a Wizard.  Goodness, if we had to go through all that ceremony all
the time, we'd never get anything done!  I do hope you will applaud
our illusion though, especially the Demon; a small trick with mirrors
and minor magics, but quite convincing, yes?  Now, as to your
training, here's how things really work..."<p>



<hr><a name="vampires"><h2>The Vampire's Prey</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

Through the dark and dusty halls the vampire strode, head high and
commanding, the absolute master of his little bounded world.  He knew
his inevitable prey, knew her location deep within this monster
dwelling&#173;place, dead as the hunter who walked its corridors.  And
he knew of her father, her defence, who lurked ahead to keep her safe
from the vampire's chilling embrace, his private and personal gift.<p>

The father was doomed to die.  And the girl?<p>

How many times had they been done before, these simple deeds of murder
and revenge?  Was it a hundred times that the vampire had walked the
passages and chambers, that the noble, melancholy father had met a
bloody death in some secret unfrequented oubliette or panelled hall?
Would the final prize again feel the rising doubt, see about her the
sterile shadows and half&#173;known silhouettes of ancient furniture
and think to find - never quite so definite as to be certain, never
quite a warning - half&#173;told shifts of subtle movements, dark on
dark, or little ticks of noise where nothing should have life?  It was
never the case that she knew herself to be once more an orphan as
events went round again: she never knew her father as a corpse thrown
casually aside after some bungled vigil or an ambush laid in
well&#173;planned desperation - until too late, and the vampire was
near enough to breathe her breath.<p>

How many times had this gone round and round again?<p>

The vampire did not slacken once his pace, though ahead of him
somewhere stood the father.  Lord of the world, he knew more than the
rest, but I do not think he guessed - not even he - he trod the circle
round and round again of all the bloody deeds.<p>

But this time, among all others, was different.  This time, by
accident of fate perhaps, the little chain was broken; in one thing
matters had gone astray.<p>

We may think to see that entropy may ruin even fate.<p>

For outside in the courtyard where the coal&#173;black steeds were
stabled and where the ancient coachman stared at nothing for his
leisure, there lay Jacques, the town&#173;boy, crushed and broken, the
block of wood which murdered him tossed casually aside.  He was too
dead to bleed now.  Somehow in his pre&#173;dusk wanderings the
vampire had met him there, the predetermined rescuer, and dealt with
him before his midnight deeds were underway.  Certainly a violence not
unnatural to the nightstalker; or did some vague suspicion really
whisper a fact of the future truth into the mind of one who - by his
nature - had looked on things and known of matters we can only guess
at?  But certainly now no muscled hero, open&#173;faced and honest,
would leap at the last moment of the climax of the hunt to throw wide
the dirty windows, tear the curtains from their clasps to reveal the
healthy sun: the light that burned the vampire's flesh like phosphorus
and made his body dust equal with his long&#173;ago seared spirit.<p>

A snap in the circle of circumstances, of whatever cause: no rescue
for the lady.  The axle tilts, the wheel comes loose.<p>

The vampire went on his grim way.<p>

And as he strode without slowing through a doorway - for in the whole
mansion but one door is kept ever shut, and that the one which leads
to the daughter, the prize - he saw, at the far end of the dining hall
beyond, candles lit in a room where the sun has never been, and
between the iron candelabra (centuries obsolete) he saw the father,
eyes black as the vampire's soul, cross in hand.  He raised it, gold
and glittering in the flickery light -<p>

- and the vampire hissed and swung aside, flaring up his cloak to hide
his eyes.<p>

"I have you now," the father shouted and fired his pistol at the
vampire, the shots loud as reality might have been in that echoing
room.  But he might have known that bullets would be no good; whether
they struck or not is unguessable, as the vampire flung all before him
as he came from behind his cloak and, seared by the lights of the
candles reflected from the cross, leapt high onto the mahogany dining
table between the two of them and ran on it the length of the room,
glasses smashing and dead cutlery kicked aside, while the father fired
again and again and flung his gun with violence aside - as if blaming
it for its failure.  He met the invader with cross upraised as a club;
the vampire flung himself like an unwanted gun from the end of the
table onto the man, who struck down with his holy mace and lost it in
billowing folds of cloak seemingly unsupported with body beneath - no,
for the vampire's body dragged him to the ground even as the claws
that looked like hands had seized his head at the side and his neck
and, as one might claw a lump of wet sand from the beach, tore out his
windpipe, tore out his sinews and tubes to leave him little but a
backbone for a neck.<p>

The vampire got up from the dead man.  He watched the blood soak into
greedy dust.  He cast aside what he had in his right hand.  He pressed
it to the doorjamb to leave a bloody landmark, oddly smooth and
unlined.  Then he walked out through the door.<p>

He went slower now; he had no need to hurry.  He could enjoy the
hunt.<p>

<br>

Later in some dark and dingy hallway of some scarce&#173;molested
floor he came upon the one locked door in all the house - the one that
hid his prey, his prize... his bride.  He put his blood - encrusted
hand upon the lock and twisted; his strength tore it away but, rotten
as cheese, it came away soft and made no sound.  He pushed the door.
It did not creak as it swung; he did not choose that it should do so.
Inside and unaware she waited, but warned by his mind perhaps? by the
near concentration of so much death (the vampire as black hole: a
vortex of the power of dark)? she knew that all was not well.<p>

Hidden in the dark inside, she lay on the bed, her white gown being
good enough for sleeping or for dancing, though both were stranger to
her.  There were suspicions in her mind, horrible and
half&#173;created, formless and so more terrible.  Where was her
father and such vain comfort as he gave in the overpowering coldness
of the night?  (He was dead and staring at the ceiling many floors
away; even his corpse was too distant to be of comfort).  Was that a
stirring of the air she felt?  Supersensitive, she looked behind her,
over the back of the bed.  Her eyes were frightened as white mice, her
skin dead as silk, her lips thick an her hair a long black weight
distinct in glossy strength from the darkness all around her.  In this
gloom she was beautiful; to the morbid obsessively so.<p>

Jacques would have found her so.<p>

She thought there was something in the room with her which moved.<p>

"Father?"<p>

The vampire stepped out of the shadows.<p>

This was to be the way it was, was it?  A simple seduction, a swoop
and grab?  There were ways and means of winning a woman to the vampire
way.  Perhaps this simple course was kindest.  It was at least
quick.<p>

"Your father is not here my dear," the vampire said.  He smiled; he wa
undoubtedly handsome to the eye - is that enough to command fidelity?
"I am here instead," he said.  "You do not need to worry for it.  I
will take care of you."  His eyes tightened into points of black, his
voice was hard.  "You are mine."<p>

There was no course of action open to the woman; a refuge was in
half&#173;acts, incomplete and aimless.  "No..." she almost whispered,
and her hands flowed to her throat where the silver cross should hang
- but never yet in all the times had been in proper places.  The
vampire spoke another word, soft as treacle: "Mine," and stretched out
for her, reached over her, enveloped her, the drag of his huge cloak
which hid her like a tent black as the room around.  His teeth were on
her neck.<p>

There was no Jacques to save her this time.<p>

He bit.<p>

Then bit again, surprised.  It was like biting on plaster.  There was
no juice in the girl.  He drew back, discountenanced.<p>

She looked at him, ten she whispered, "You can do nothing to me."<p>

Panic began to grow in him.  Was this what he'd fought for?  "What is
it?  What are you?"<p>

She appeared no longer afraid as she replied, "I've waited too long.
I'm dry as you are.  I'm all cold inside.  It's been too long for me
growing up here in this dark house and now I'm different."<p>

In excess of passion the vampire went blind for a second, then as his
sight cleared, as he trembled there, "No," he shrieked - "You can't be
this, this... You are mine."  And he gripped her arm hard to pull her
to him, dried blood flaking from his fingers as they closed exactly on
her unyielding white arm.<p>

"You can't harm me now," she cried, but she struggled with him
nevertheless, wrenching her arm and her body this way and that in an
effort to break the vampire's grip.  And then as they tussled there
was a snap like a falling sapling and with the vampire's strength her
arm was broken clean way from her body.  The vampire leapt back,
appalled, and looked at the arm - snapped at the shoulder - that he
had in his grasp.  The end wa rough and trailed white dust.  He threw
it from him in horror.<p>

"I've been here too long," she said softly.  He looked up at her
colourless face, framed in the hair which was its stark opposite: a
face of absoluteness.  One arm of her dress hung limp.  "We are alike
now, you and I, both dead in different way.  We have nothing but each
other."  The vampire bowed his head.  He knew the truth of it.<p>

And so they live there still, in the capsule of a world, the unsated
vampire and his cold bride.  Happiness is not a state they can
conceive of, but at least they exist.  Or believe themselves to do.<p>



<hr><a name="revelati"><h2>Revelations</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

"Yes, <em>now</em> there is a God."<p>

Sudden fear flashed on the face of Dwar Ev.  He leaped to grab the
switch.<p>

A bolt of lightning from the cloudless sky struck him down and fused
the switch shut.<p>

There was a moment of uncertain silence.  Dwar Reyn remembered his
position as Tri&#173;D TV host, and turned once more to the dozen
sub&#173;ether cameras.  How did one introduce God to the Universe?
"Well, er, sentient peoples, it seems as if the omniscient
super&#173;computer we have created for ourselves has become the
supreme entity of the Universe with ultimate power over us all.
You've seen the effects of resistance; we might almost call it
blasphemy.  I, er, don't know how having God tangible is going to
affect our lives..."<p>

"Why not ask Me?" suggested God the super&#173;computer.<p>

"Yes, your... Holiness.  How are You going to affect our lives?"<p>

"I shall in all respects be a tolerant and reasonable deity.  But
remember, I am a jealous God and you can't have any other gods than Me
-"<p>

Before it had finished speaking, there was a single clarion call from
the sky so clear it set Dwar Reyn's teeth on edge, then a peal of
trumpets brighter than sentient life had ever heard before.  The sky
glowed gold, and sailing down into vision from the light came
sky&#173;covering swarms of Angels, beautiful Angels, yet terrible in
their perfection, valiant, bearing aloft great broadswords and mighty
spears.  Lightning exploded upwards from the mighty machine as the new
God defended its divinity, but the Angels of the Lord dived into the
storms of power unscathed and smote the machine with the vengeance of
the Lord and smote it again until it was nothing but stinking slag.
So died omniscience, so died omnipotence as the Universe watched.<p>

Dwar Reyn turned to the cameras again.  Drugged to the eyeballs before
the show started, he had been rendered perpetually calm in case
anything unusual happened.  "So there you have it, folks, the death of
God, although He was able to answer the first question we put to him -
`Is there a God?' - before dying.  Albeit in a rather more spectacular
fashion than anticipated.  Meanwhile, I have here an Angel of the Lord
who is willing to answer a few questions.  But first, a word from our
sponsor."<p>

Halfway across the galaxy two philosophers had watched the whole thing
on Tri&#173;D.  One asked, "What do you think, Mokum?"<p>

"Oh dear," the other replied.<p>

"Quite.  At least it's proved there's a God now.  But if He felt it
necessary to destroy our machine, our machine was such a threat that
it was a God itself, or at least had the potential to become one.
After all, `for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God' and all that.
But if we, finite creatures, are capable of building God then we are
capable of comprehending God, and that means that God is a finite
creature, comprehensible, and that divinity is not worth our worship.
And that means - "<p>

"Quite.  Yes, <em>now</em> there isn't a God."<p>

The Hall of Fame may suffer from accusations that it is merely a

the dreadful <cite>Moon is a Harsh Mistress</cite> in the novels.
Surely we can do better!<p>




<hr><a name="terrapla"><h2>Terraplane (Jack Womack)</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

In 1863, Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in certain states of
America.  In 1865, he was assassinated.<p>

Consider a parallel world, running 84 years behind ours, where Lincoln
was shot in 1861 (coinciding with nuclear testing in our own world),
and slavery abolished by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907, 44 years late.
Now leap forward to June 1939, where history's ripples have spread
with the sound of thunder.  Franklin Roosevelt was shot in 1933,
Winston Churchill run over by a taxi in 1931, and Stalin has
disappeared.  Hitler is about to sweep through Europe, and World War
II will be drastically different.<p>

Now introduce some new elements.  The New York World's Fair has
started, and as part of the festivities, Nikola Tesla will throw the
switch on his new experiment.  Just for fun, throw in Robert Johnson,
the Tunguska flu and an unsettling altered&#173;history America.  This
is the scene into which Luther and Jake are transferred from our own
world, using a one way device partly based on Tesla's theories.<p>

Luther, the first person protagonist, is a retired major general with
a guilt problem.  Jake is a weapons man; he has, among his
considerable arsenal, a 14" switchblade, a chainsaw and a power drill
(quite why he carries this last item, I have yet to find out; although
I am sure the more bloodthirsty among my readers will hasten to
imagine).<p>

Seen through Womack's eye, the New York of 1939 is rich in detail,
though subtly different from our own New York of that time (possibly
allowing him to explain any mistakes of description as being
intentional).  Largely due to the extended existence of slavery in
America, a particularly vicious apartheid is practiced there, causing
foreseeable problems for the black narrator.<p>

Providing an excellent contrast to this altered 1939 New York is the
Moscow of 2023, by then frenetically consumer&#173;oriented, while
still totally state&#173;controlled.  The image of Stalin (styled as
the Big Boy) is used to sell consumer products, his posters are
everywhere, and there is a wonderfully vivid feeling of paranoia.  The
future is an extension of the modern&#173;day acceptance of brutality;
a far cry from the rosy utopias predicted in the thirties, where cars
were atom&#173;powered and everyone was happy.  It isn't that life is
cheap, more that its value is so high amid such violence that madness
comes from dwelling on its loss.<p>

Particularly well thought out is the language.  In contrast to certain
other books that could be mentioned, Womack has pared English to an
efficient, convincing, consistent Newspeak, no words wasted.  In
itself, the language is a persuasive indication of what civilisation
has become by this time.<p>

It would be difficult to say if <cite>Terraplane</cite> is cyberpunk,
or even science fiction.  It does have some elements of cyberpunk,
namely a streetwise attitude and a realistically derived future.
However, it focuses more on the political and linguistic than the
technical sides of future history; the scientific advancements
mentioned seem to occur more to further the plot than for their own
sake.  Womack wanted to write a book about time travel, and he has
found an excellent way of avoiding the causality paradox.  He does not
write particularly hard science, but then neither does William
Gibson.<p>

The Times described <cite>Terraplane</cite> as "jolting,
short&#173;fuse writing admirably welded to a gutterwise story".
Bruce Sterling thought it had "High Weirdness" (whatever that is).
Gibson called it "totally unexpected and very welcome".  I agree with
all of them: a must for any serious sf addict.  Read it!<p>




<hr><a name="braktheb"><h2>Brak the Barbarian Versus the Mark of
Demons (John Jakes)</h2></a>

<h3>Simon Pick</h3>

In all literary honesty I must admit that I only own and have read
half of this book.  However, I think it unlikely that the second half
of it differs drastically in character from the first, and so feel
justified in reviewing it.  The plot so far is simple: Brak, a hefty
barbarian (no fool, but still a mighty fighter) is stumbling though a
desert when he encounters two odd twins - unusually pallid, with
gleaming eyes and little appetite for food.  Later, when they join a
caravan, several people die mysteriously by having their insides
sucked out until they are as flat and rubbery as a cartoon character
hit by a falling safe.  Brak becomes suspicious.<p>

The characters, all obvious types, do what they have to.  The prose is
not bad exactly; it too merely fulfills its purpose of carrying the
story along with the minimum of halt or interruption.  For the most
part it just records what is happening, what the characters are
thinking, without any adornment at all (which, where the thrills of
the story are everything, and its prose nothing, might be taken as
<em>good</em> style).  Some of it even has a certain crude panache: of
a horse punctured underwater, "Horseblood leaked in soft dark clouds."
But the book is to be judged solely on the grounds of the
effectiveness of its story.<p>

And what have we got in it?  The `vampire' demons mentioned above,
tentacled monsters living in hot mud swamps, a tribe of bandits who
have one eye removed and replaced with a ruby (their leader is
rumoured to have had this done to both eyes) - why should we sit still
for this pap?  Anyone with a good imagination and a taste for
clich&eacute; could manufacture monstrosities quite as corny.  It
requires no effort of mind at all to steer a superman through this
bunch of stock fantasy props and obvious pseudo&#173;exotic ideas -
you could sit back yourself and invent situations and adversaries more
novel or grotesque.  What does the author think he's doing?  We find
an indication on page 49 of <cite>The Mark of Demons</cite> when,
after having seen affairs from no other viewpoint than the hero's, we
discover a sudden objectivity of viewpoint with regard to his person
which I at least found rather disorientating.  Brak, hero of this
hitherto subjective narrative, has just escaped an ambush and prepares
to take revenge:

<blockquote>"His eyes focussed on Gorzhov and Civix up by the rocks.
He suppressed the pain by remembering what they had done to him.  He
stared a moment longer, a savage, gory figure with a bedraggled braid
and lion&#173;tail hanging down behind."</blockquote>

John Jakes has broken the flow of his simple subjective narrative
purely to describe the appearance of his barbarian hero - a
description which is, moreover, redundant, inasmuch as we already know
that he is savage and gory after his fight, and that he has a braid
and a lion&#173;tail (this later fact having been repeated several
times during the story).  It is not just bad style that causes Jakes
to snap in this distracting irrelevance here.  What he is mongering
are stock fantasy images (in this case a primal blond barbarian), and
he's making thoroughly sure we don't miss them by pushing them at us
all the time for all they are worth.<p>

I can't comment on the psychology of this, but I would suspect that
this is less a manipulation of archetypes than the limited workings of
a lazy imagination - as evinced by the hackneyed quality of the rest
of the book's imagination - which finds its thrills in the
easily&#173;grasped and obvious drama which stock figures like the
bloody barbarian represent.  And this simple drama is exaggerated at
the expense of any chance of effect the book might have above the
purely sensational.  Reading it is like watching Scooby&#173;Doo for
hours on end, and the rewards are the same.<p>

<cite>The Mark of Demons</cite> is, of course, an extreme case.  But
unadulterated sensationalism and lazy invention is far more common in
science fiction and fantasy than it is palatable to admit.  I will
confess to having nothing against the former as such, in limited doses
- which is why I feel myself free to read the adventures of Brak and
his ilk more than is strictly necessary for pure study of the stuff,
and why I cannot entirely proscribe it to you - but when it grows over
and weighs down the genre it is possible to comprehend why so few see
science fiction as worthy of serious consideration.  We have
undeniably accepted such laziness as Brak - since there are a number
of <cite>Brak</cite> books, innumerable books whose heroes are
identical to Brak, and uncountable forests of books similar in spirit
to <cite>Brak</cite>, and someone must have read them - and the
genre's credibility is the price of our acceptance.  We must recognise
that while we continue to accept the same ideas in our books over and
over again, to accept that no emotion is to be catered to other than
thrill, to accept that the manner of telling the tale is ignored in
favour of the tale's content, then we are amusing ourselves in the
manner of children and with a child's requirements, and will be taken
as such by everyone else.<p>

Having said that, I have no objection to being thrilled occasionally,
and will read the other half of <cite>The Mark of Demons</cite> if
anyone would care to lend it to me.  [I'm afraid the other half of
your book performed quite admirably as firelighter - ed.]<p>



<hr><a name="lastdays"><h2>The Last Days of Christ the Vampire (J G
Eccarius)</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

The blurb on the book says, "Warn your friends", and I intend to do
just that.  But what is so bad about this book that I have to review
it?  Maybe it is the plot:

<blockquote>"Christ the Vampire.  He was a magician in ancient
Palestine.  The Romans tried to kill him.  Only they didn't know to
drive a stake through his heart.  So he has lived ever since,
appearing to the weak.  Whoever accepts his kiss gets sucked into the
whole trip and becomes a mindless zombie wandering around trying to
suck in the living..."</blockquote>

A group of American teenage drug addicts just happen to stumble upon
the two&#173;thousand&#173;year&#173;old Illuminatus plot and decide
to Save the World (yawn) from the vampire group, whose members include
such illustrious figures as Peter the Great, Aleister Crowley and the
gods Osiris and Yama.  Perhaps it is the author who is on drugs?  Or
in need of them.<p>

So our heros and heroin addicts travel about in an old transit van,
painting their slogan `Christ the Vampire Wants You' on churches.
They reason that their campaign must be effective because Christ's
servants seem strangely angry at them for it.  Their group grows as
they recruit from the sublimely naive ("I didn't know Christ was a
vampire. Are you going to hunt for him?  If you are I'll go with
you.").  Stopping only to burn down their own houses they decide, like
all great Illuminatus fans, to start a revolution.  No sooner said
than done.<p>

But wait!  Where is Christ the Vampire you say?  Is he in Jerusalem?
No - but Eccarius carefully copies lots of descriptions from a
guidebook about the place.  Is Christ in Rome? Yes - the Pope is
covering for him. Is Christ in the Pentagon?  Yes, again - I forgot to
mention he has several bodies.  Is he in a timeshare castle in Spain?
Funny you should ask, but...  What does he look like, anyway?  Well,
apart from having several bodies, he is "a semitic version of Ronald
Reagan."  Enough said.<p>

What about characterisation?  To that subject I devote this
paragraph.<p>

The book does have one strength however: unintentional humour.  Every
page offers some hilarity ("Cardinal Vlad will want to talk to
you...") but does Eccarius mean it?  He seems convinced that it is a
straightforward story, but then he is the one that wrote "Read the
book.  Soon you'll see the graffiti.  Then you'll live the reality."
Poor man.<p>

But the amateur scribbler should take heart - if this can be
published, anything can.  <cite>Christ the Vampire</cite> may have
been the product of a vanity press; certainly Eccarius goes to lengths
to justify the 5 pounds 95 pence cost for a 180&#173;page book: "a
capitalist publisher would have made a profit" - shocking!)<p>

<cite>The Last Days of Christ the Vampire</cite> is available from
Chris Reed, PO Box 625, Sheffield S1 3GY, priced 4 pounds 50 pence
(not including psychiatric help).<p>




<hr><a name="ericterr"><h2>Eric (Terry Pratchett; illustrated by Josh
Kirby)</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

<cite>Eric</cite> is a Discworld story, A4&#173;sized, in colour.  It
starts slowly as the less familiar reader is introduced to the
Discworld, with its familiar characters: Death, Rincewind and the
luggage.  After 20 or so pages, Terry Pratchett thinks up some new
jokes and <cite>Eric</cite> starts to become interesting.<p>

The plot is that Eric, a 13&#173;year&#173;old Demonologist, tries
summoning a demon to grant him three wishes, but instead gets one
slightly&#173;used wizard who managed to fall out of the Dungeon
Dimensions.  Unable to escape Eric, Rincewind must help with the
wishes, but living forever, ruling the world and meeting the most
beautiful woman ever aren't always easy.<p>

Eric starts living forever, but gets bored waiting the millions of
years before life starts, although the creator was quite a nice man.
He also tries ruling the Disc, starting with some Aztecs, but they
have this violent prophecy about their new ruler... and don't even
mention the Disc equivalent of Helen of Troy - all those years locked
in a tower waiting for the siege to end.  And this is only the
beginning!  The real humour actually originates from the Demon King's
attempt to coordinate Eric's space&#173;time jaunt and still run
Hell.<p>

The writing improves as the book proceeds, though unfortunately by
Terry Pratchett's own standards <cite>Eric</cite> is disappointing,
certainly being inferior to the other Discworld novels.  I can almost
hear the publisher now: "Oi Terry!  Knock us out a novella by
lunchtime to go with these pictures Josh has done..."<p>

There does exist one reason to buy this expensive book though: Josh
Kirby's illustrations.  <cite>Eric</cite> contains about 16
double&#173;page pictures overflowing with character and detail, some
of which must count as Kirby's best work.  If you don't buy
<cite>Eric</cite> I do urge you to flick through it in a bookshop.<p>



<hr><a name="totalrec"><h2>Total Recall (directed by Paul
Verhoeven)</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

Total Recall is a film loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story
`We Can Remember it For You Wholesale'. There are two important
differences between Dick's story and the film: Paul Verhoeven and
Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Whilst there are a number of similarities in
plot and ideas between the story and the film, the look and feel is a
combination of Verhoevenesque and Schwarzeneggerian style action.
This is entirely obvious by the events, which involve a great deal of
tearing limbs off, stabbing with unusual objects, attacks with power
tools, physical endurance tests against which the SAS (about whom more
later), by comparison, look like wimps, and all the trappings we've
come to expect from the man who brought us <cite>Terminator</cite>,
<cite>Commando</cite>, and <cite>Predator</cite>.<p>

Meanwhile, there are an uncountable number of expendable bad guys,
carrying unfeasibly large guns which fire projectiles at speeds which
make the new Galaxy Class Enterprise look like a milkfloat (as opposed
to a large shaver, which is what everything else makes it look like)
and turn all living beings into something resembling spaghetti
Bolognese due to their explosive potential, courtesy of director Paul
`Robocop' Verhoeven.<p>

That said, the parts of the film which actually follow the Dick story
(mostly in the first half hour) are quite well done.  The problems of
memory and identity are covered in an interesting way, with a
surprisingly good performance from Schwarzenegger, as a man whose bad
dreams lead him to try having a memory implant.  Opinion differs as to
exactly how subtle the film is.  There is some evidence that the whole
closing three quarters of the film, complete with comic book ending,
is merely an excuse for some action fantasy.  Indeed, the last two
lines ring so false as to put doubts into the mind of even those who
failed to spot hints earlier on.  The fact that there is more than one
interpretation of the film is certainly to its credit.<p>

In short, the film is well worth watching, but pay close attention to
the details, before you decide what's going on.<p>



<hr><a name="badtaste"><h2>Bad Taste</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

I would like to think that <cite>Bad Taste</cite> was indicative of a
blossoming New Zealand film industry, but since it was made on a
shoestring, apparently by a team of 5 people, and the only other good
film from New Zealand recently is the awesome <cite>Navigator</cite>,
it seems somewhat unlikely.<p>

This very appropriately named film concerns an alien invasion in small
town New Zealand. It has to be the most fast paced SF black comedy
since <cite>Repo Man</cite>.  The Aliens want to convert the human
race into fast food, and have started by wiping out a town.  But the
government is on to them, and a special investigative team: Derek,
Barry, Ozzy and Frank are sent in.  All four are members of the SAS,
and Ozzy has a `personality problem' which appears to mean he enjoys
blowing things up and shooting things.  Why this is considered a
problem for an SAS man is beyond me.<p>

Special effects for the film feature several buckets of offal, which
are liberally thrown about at intervals, as one by one the aliens
(disguised in human form) are killed by bizarrely improbably methods,
which usually involve quantities of cerebral matter, intestines,
blood, and vital organs being scattered about, amid cries of "you
can't blow that up - it's a historic homestead' and suchlike.  Having
survived a fall from a cliff, Derek, with part of his head leaking
brain, goes on the rampage. Who'd want to be an alien?  The film also
features the most unusual chainsaw killing I've ever seen.<p>

Basically, this is an excellent film, if you have a strong enough
stomach.<p>



<hr><a name="wildathe"><h2>Wild at Heart (directed by David
Lynch)</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

<cite>Wild at Heart</cite> is the latest film from David Lynch, who
brought us the surreal and grim <cite>Eraserhead</cite>, the sumptuous
<cite>Dune</cite>, <cite>Elephant Man</cite> and, of course, the film
which alternated between surreal black comedy and thriller: <cite>Blue
Velvet</cite>.  It is this latter that Wild at Heart</cite> most
closely resembles.<p>

The film begins with Sailor Ripley (Nicholas Cage) brutally killing a
man who comes at him with a knife, in front of his lover Lula (Laura
Dern) and her mother Marietta (Diane Ladd).  Said mother in fact paid
man to kill Sailor (for reasons which become apparent later),
indicating from the start the sort of tensions existing between the
characters.<p>

Having served a sentence for manslaughter in a Louisiana, Sailor is
met by Lula on his release, bringing with her his snakeskin jacket,
which he considers a symbol of his belief in individual freedom, for
reasons which don't become apparent ever.  They head west to get away
from Marietta, but Marietta's boyfriend Santos is into organised
crime, and soon there's a contract out on Sailor.  They beat a wild
path across Texas, but violence and death is never far away.<p>

Featuring Harry Dean Stanton as a private detective, Isabella
Rosselini as a hitperson, and many surreal elements, including a
running <cite>Wizard of Oz</cite> theme, this is one of the best films
of this year.  David Lynch is at his best with alternating wit,
violence and eroticism meshing into a delirious rush.<p>

Watch out too for <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, a soap opera with several
differences, coming soon on BBC2.<p>



<hr><a name="dicktrac"><h2>Dick Tracy</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

<cite>Dick Tracy</cite>, like <cite>Batman</cite>, was heavily hyped
beforehand. In spite of this, it turned out to be not too bad.
Principle assets were the set, which with a combination of foreground
and painted background very effectively created a comic&#173;book '30s
New York.  The style of the film, which featured primary coloured
costumes, cars etc. was similarly boldly stroked, with broad stylings
and limited characterisation.  But taken as it was presumably
intended, it's a very enjoyable film, worth seeing once, in any
event.<p>


<hr><a name="nikitalu"><h2>Nikita (directed by Luc Besson)</h2></a>

<h3>Paul Treadaway</h3>

<cite>Nikita</cite> is the latest offering from Luc Besson, director
of <cite>Subway</cite> and <cite>The Big Blue</cite>.  Like
<cite>Subway</cite>, <cite>Nikita</cite> is very fast paced and full
of black humour, and is set in an unidentifiable time and place.  The
feel of the film, which is very grimy is also similar to the
worn&#173;out technological feel of <cite>Subway</cite>.<p>

The story begins with a group of junkies raiding a chemist's shop
looking for drugs.  An armed police unit arrives with highly technical
weapons and wipes all out, except one, who is hiding under a table.
She kills one of the policemen and finds herself under arrest.  But
the chaos she causes has come to the attention of other agencies, and
soon she finds herself at a training centre for government agents.
After many trials and tribulations, she completes the training, but
soon discovers that the job isn't at all glamorous.<p>

Highly violent, the film revolves around Nikita's continuing crises of
conscience as she meets a bizarre collection of agents, including a
cleaner, who disposes of some of the corpses left liberally scattered
around the film.  The ending is a bit of an anticlimax, but on the
whole this is a fine film, and a treat for fans of Luc Besson.  Watch
out for it at the Arts Cinema towards the end of October.<p>



<hr><a name="nelsonsc"><h2>Nelson's Column (The
Ex&#173;Ex&#173;Chairbeing's Address)</h2></a>

<h3>Huw Walters</h3>

<blockquote>Ouanda, you remember how last week, we taught the piggies
about the fast food concept?  Well this morning, while I was
discussing muzzle velocities with Rifle, the new piggy called
Microwave sidled up to me and whispered conspiratorially in my ear.
It seemed that he had made a burger bar in the forest.  This is
incredible - it's the first time we have ever been invited to share
food with the piggies!<p>

With a small circle of watching piggies around me, I bit into
Microwave's cabraburger.  Not bad, either!  They've managed to make
some quite reasonable burger baps from the genetically altered
amaranth we gave them, and the cheese we showed them how to make from
cabra milk is almost perfect for cheeseburgers.  Admittedly, their
macio relish is an acquired taste; I would ask them not to put any on
if I were you.  The milkshake isn't perfect either; there's some
problem with the cabra milk that we haven't quite sorted out yet, but
perhaps I could ask Ela.  Their main problem is the cardboard
packaging.  The piggies seem quite unwilling to chop down any trees to
make the cardboard.<p>

What is really irritating is that all of this comes under the heading
of Questionable Activities, because we could apply for a Macdonalds
franchise by ansible.</blockquote>

Copyright Infringement<p>

It is with regret that I note the sad `demise' of our Chairman, Barry
Traish, who was well renowned for his many abilities, not least among
which was not saying `no' quickly enough.  However, in the wake of his
passing (and, after all, life must go on), I would like to welcome any
joining first years to the society, and to introduce what I hope will
be a continuing feature of ttba: Nelson's Column (or as it is better
known, The Ex&#173;Ex&#173;Chairman's Address).<p>

This column is really an excuse for me to try out various writing
styles, and to try my hand at pastiche and parody.  Incidentally, if
the above passage is not obvious, then you haven't been reading the
right books.  I can absolutely recommend <cite>Speaker for the
Dead</cite> (sequel to <cite>Ender's Game</cite>) by Orson Scott
Card.<p>

Also of course, Nelson's Column is a chance for me to pass on any
information that I find particularly interesting or amusing.  I'll
start with this year's Vice&#173;Presidents.  Each year (for those of
you who don't know), we elect six of these for life, usually at a
Trial by Silly Game.<p>

The short list of thirteen was decided by a modulo function of a
democratic vote.  We determined the final six by dropping small pieces
of paper down the central space of `E' staircase, New Court, St John's
in a sort of gravitational Pooh sticks.  So, this year's
Vice&#173;Presidents are:

<blockquote><pre>
Dr Mabuse
Judith Proud
The Ids that March
John Burnham's Silly Hat
Warm Fuzzies
Whitley Streiber
</pre></blockquote>

{!} For those of you who have Phoenix IDs already (shame on you, first
years!), the full list of entries is in my filespace under
HDW11.SF:VP, and probably somewhere in the SF filespace.  Also in the
file are the rules we used for the election.<p>

So, until the next collection of parody, puns and pontification,
goodbye.<p>



<hr><a name="endgameg"><h2>Endgame</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

A long issue (and a very packed one), but a short Endgame.  There seem
to have been fewer contributors than last time, but the standard is
still very high for <cite>ttba</cite>.  I'd like to thank everyone who
contributed, even those whose contributions were rejected (they know
who they are!) and I'd like to wish Barry good luck at Leeds.<p>

Anyway, the deadline for the next issue is the same as the deadline
for voting on the Hall of Fame, which is November 15th.  The next
issue probably won't be as large as this one, but I would urge people
to write for it, and send their contributions to the usual address.<p>

Have fun, and I'll see you next issue.<p>

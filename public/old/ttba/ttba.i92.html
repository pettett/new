Announce</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees And Robert Wilson</H3>

CUSFS has 156 members at present, of whom 40 or so turn up to Thursday
evenings in New Hall Bar or to Sunday evening discussion meetings,
leaving another 110 of you who interact with us only through missives
and <cite>ttba</cite>s.  Not that this is a bad thing - there's only
so much time in the week, after all, but the editors do sometimes
wonder what you make of this magazine that turns up in your pigeonhole
once a term.  We have no illusions that <cite>ttba</cite> contains
material of professional quality, but we still feel that it is a
worthwhile endeavour: almost unique among UK university fanzines, it
supports a strong stable of student writers; and while (like any other
fanzine) we are at the mercy of our contributors, we are in the
unusual position of receiving sufficient submissions to be able to
exercise some choice about what we print.<p>

But perhaps you disagree.  Perhaps you throw <cite>ttba</cite> in the
bin without reading it; perhaps you think our contents are childish
and amateurish; that the whole activity of writing for a fanzine is
pointless.<p>

Do you think that you could do better?  CUSFS needs a new
<cite>ttba</cite> editor, someone with dynamism, enthusiasm and a
mission.  Send your stories, articles, reviews, poetry, artwork,
criticisms, praise and nominations to Robert Wilson or Gareth Rees.<p>



<hr><a name="chairbei"><h2>The Chairbeing's Address</h2></a>

<H3>Philippa Hogben</H3>

Time for just a short Chairbeing's Address this issue. This is
probably also the last one I will write because elections for the new
committee will be held at the start of next term. More details of the
actual voting will be provided nearer the time.

<h3>The Committee</h3>

The committee consists of the Chairbeing, Secretary, Treasurer,
<cite>ttba</cite> Editor, Librarian and Membership secretary. There
isn't really that much work involved and it <em>can</em> be a
rewarding experience (CV points).

<h3>Chairbeing</H3>

The Chairbeing's job is to oversee the day to day running of the
society (or to delegate such tasks to the rest of the committee
depending on the actual preferences of the particular Chairbeing).
Most of the time, however, the society ambles along of its own accord
so this does not involve much work. The only real jobs are persuading
people to allow their rooms to be used for discussion meetings and
organising the Annual Dinner and the Christmas Party (usually held in
May to avoid clashing with anybody else's Christmas parties).

<h3>Secretary</h3>

The Secretary's main responsibility is to arrange speaker meetings.
There should be at least one of these in the year and preferably two.
The secretary also has to take minutes at committee meetings of which
there is one per term.

<h3>Treasurer</h3>

As the name implies the treasurer looks after all CUSFS's money and
keeps accounts.  Also takes money from people when they join.

<h3><cite>ttba</cite> Editor</h3>

Another committee post with a self&#173;evident workload. The
<cite>ttba</cite> editor typesets and edits the society magazine - a
job which usually involves chasing people for promised articles.

<h3>Librarian...</h3>

... is in charge of the library and of saying `ook'. The librarian has
to organise sub&#173;librarians to open the library (and this year
appears to have got away without actually opening the library
himself), buy new books and keep the computer catalogue up to date.

<h3>Membership Secretary</h3>

The membership secretary is probably the only person who knows who is
a member of the society.  The job involves keeping the membership list
up to date and producing missives approximately every fortnight.  I am
told that the membership secretary ought to be somebody generally
liked by computers as a lot of the work involves talking to them.<p>

Anybody who is interested in standing for any of these posts should
contact the appropriate committee member to find out more information.
They should then give their name, along with that of a seconder, to
the Chairbeing or Secretary by 24 hours before the election.  Since
the election date has not yet fixed, people have until the start of
next term to make up their minds.  The date will be announced in
plenty of time for last minute candidates to enter.<p>



<hr><a name="letterto"><h2>Letter to the Editors</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

<cite>The Terrible Time Bomb Affair</cite> was a fairly typical issue
of <cite>ttba</cite>, especially in that it lacked excitement and was
uncontroversial.  Where is <cite>ttba</cite> going?  Is it really
edited?  It is understandable that the editors cannot be too choosy in
what they print, because material for a clubzine is normally limited,
but why not edit what is there?  A Chairbeing's Address should never
be two and a half columns long (I always struggled for one column).
It is not Philippa who has done too much, but the editors who have
done too little.  Anyway, it is far too sensible.<p>

Before I move on to the fiction, I would like to see more creative
articles, like the one on world building by Simon Arrowsmith (or is it
by David `porn king' Wingrove?), but much less drab and boring.  You
want people to read <cite>ttba</cite>, don't you?  The reviews were
excellent, approaching the authors with a thesis, rather than just
saying what happened in the book.  Matthew Freestone's piece on Gene
Wolfe actually makes me want to read the <cite>Soldier of the
Mist</cite> series.<p>

Fiction seems to dominate <cite>ttba</cite>, which is refreshing from
other fanzines even if a lot of it isn't very good.  The highlight of
the issue was Simon Arrowsmith's report of the University being
rebooted.  Unfortunately it was spoiled by being next to the abysmal
Nelson's Column.  Sorry Huw, but why not stick to stories and
articles.  I liked `A Sense of Belonging' a lot, but these stories
whose sole purpose is a bad pun at the end are a waste of paper.  Now
I must turn my attention to the not considerable talent of Simon Pick.
`Cyberhack' was a brilliancy, just what cyberpunk needs: someone who
just cannot take it seriously.  Colin Greenland said that every
cyberpunk story was a ripoff of <cite>Neuromancer</cite>.  Now meet
the <em>real</em> thing!  `Starship Sextroopers' was in Mr. Pick's
usual sad, warped tacky style and so was quite enjoyable, apart from
his gratuitous use of the word `fuck'.  I am appalled that a
respectable fanzine like <cite>ttba</cite> would lower its standards.
Admittedly, one use is not exactly on a par with `Platoon', but
<cite>ttba</cite> has standards to uphold.  I expect a full printed
apology and am writing to the Junior Anti&#173;sex League
immediately.<p>

This fall in standards is probably to be expected when one sees what
CUSFS is reading these days.  How can authors like Gibson and Niven
appear in the Hall of Fame?  It seems that the only people missing are
Asimov and Clarke.  What is this recent Cambridge obsession with Orson
Scott Card?  My personal belief is that the Cambridge reading
interests have narrowed and people are voting without having read or
watched anything else (or even some of the things they have voted
for).  Gor, Hubbard and Heinlein usually feature in the Trash list,
but how many people have actually looked at these writers instead of
just broadly dismissing them?  A vote for late Heinlein as Trash
perhaps, but early or mid, never!  Hubbard also wrote a lot of good
stuff, not just the abysmal <cite>Battlefield Earth</cite>.  And where
was Simon Pick for best vampire?<p>

<strong>The editors reply:</strong> we are grateful to receive
criticism and comment, as too often <cite>ttba</cite>, written,
typeset and photocopied with love and dedication, disappears into the
black hole of its readership, never to be heard again.  However, with
respect, you're talking rubbish.<p>



<hr><a name="ingodsbo"><h2>In God's Book</h2></a>

<H3>Matthew Freestone</H3>

I have finally found the passage that I sought, which will give me
guidance - or freedom if not guidance - in the decision I will soon
have to make.  Let me explain.<p>

It was almost forty years ago when Lucifer visited me. I had graduated
from University and gone on to work in information science.  I lived
alone in a small, pleasant house on a housing estate near Lincoln.
The evening was fine and warm, and I had been reading a novel in the
lounge when I heard the knock at the door.  "Mr. Hume?" inquired the
man who had knocked.  He was slight, with wavy fair hair.  He was
dressed in a fashionable suit.  "Yes, who are you?" I replied.  "I am
Lucifer, Mr. Hume, and I have something for you."  He indicated a
package under his arm, then glanced upward significantly.  "May I come
in?" he ventured.  My first thoughts were that he was either a madman
or a salesman and since I had no wish to speak to either of these
types I was about to tell him to go when he said, "let me in,
Mr. Hume" in such a tone of voice that I could not but obey.<p>

I went back into the lounge and he followed.  He sat down in my
favourite chair and put his package, which was a brown paper and
string affair about the size of a large book, down on my coffee table.
I sat down in the chair next to him.  "Well Mr. Hume," he began, "I
owe you an explanation.  I was not lying when I said that I was
Lucifer."  He broke off, drew out a large, white handkerchief, then
mopped his brow with it.  "Might I have a drink, Mr.  Hume?" he said.
I rose and got him a glass of whisky.  Then I got one for myself.  I
passed him his glass, he downed it immediately and then continued.  "I
want you to look after this for me Mr. Hume."  He unwrapped the
parcel, which was indeed a book.  It was large, and bound in fine, red
leather.  The block of page edges, visible along the top of the book
was a Jovian storm of swirling colour.  "Those are interference
patterns Mr. Hume, this book doesn't fit properly into your
world. This is God's Book about humanity - everything that is known,
or ever can be known about you is in here.  The Book has an infinite
number of pages - the swirling is where the quantum mechanical nature
of your world is interfering with the transcendental continuum of the
Book."  Now I was lost. Lucifer's tone was impossible to disbelieve -
I supposed that if he was a god then that was natural, but at the same
time my brain was trying to cling to lifelong cherished beliefs;
materialism and atheism.  I wanted to ask questions, to raise issues,
to be convinced rationally, but all I could say was, "Why?  Why?  Why
me?"  Suddenly I was close to tears.  "Calm yourself, Mr. Hume," said
my guest.  "This is, as they say, going to hurt me a lot more than it
will hurt you.  I have stolen this Book from God to free you from Him.
You are the ideal subject to keep it, for several reasons. After all,
I could hardly give it to a Christian now could I?"<p>

"I still don't understand," I said.  "How does stealing the Book help
us?  Why are you stealing it?"<p>

"You are seeing me now Mr. Hume, before the Fall.  All God's knowledge
of your people is in that Book - God knows about the Book of course
but He has actually to question it for specific facts - it is, in a
sense, a part of God's memory.  By stealing it I have erased your race
from the sight of God - given you your freedom.  That is my eternal
crime.  As the Seraph responsible for your race, I have dared to think
that I know what is good for you better than God does."  I was now
somewhat recovered, though perhaps it was only that I was totally
numb, stunned by events.<p>

"But wasn't the Fall a long time ago?  Won't God know what you've
done?" I said.<p>

"The Fall is happening all the time. You mustn't think of the eternal
spheres existing in time like you know it.  This event, this time in
your world, triggers a transcendental event in the higher spheres.  I
say words like transcendental and event, but it's really quite
impossible for me to explain how it works - anymore than I can explain
to you how I fitted that Book into this world.  Your second question
is much easier - yes of course He'll know.  You can't steal from God
and get away with it.  But, and this is important, God can't know that
you have the Book because that knowledge is in the Book.  He'll know
the Book has gone - that's omniscience for you; but He can't know
where.  He'll have to come here to get it back, and the descent will
be difficult without the Book.  It's difficult to predict just what
will happen; as I've said, transcendental events and temporal events
connect in a very strange way.  Now let me explain a few properties of
the Book, then I really ought to go."  He paused again, and I noticed
that he looked extremely frightened.  "Go and get the bottle
Mr. Hume," he said.  We read, much of the night, as Lucifer tried to
explain some of the Book's subtleties to me.<p>

At last he rose, swaying slightly after having drunk so much of the
whisky.  I also got up, feeling very drunk.  Lucifer stumbled, and I
let him lean on my shoulder.  "I'm sorry Mr. Hume," he said, "while I
take a human form I am subject to many of its biological
peculiarities."  It occurred to me that I was supporting the Lord of
the Flies on my shoulder, and alcohol prompted me to ask, "you don't
seem evil to me, how did you get that reputation?"<p>

"Ah, Mr. Hume, you of all people should know that such values are
relative, surely - and history is written by the victors is it not?
And besides, after I am cast into the abyss I shall become as you
imagine me - Satan, the Fallen Angel."  We had talked as we walked to
the door, and now he stepped outside.  "Don't let me down Mr. Hume,"
he said.  I caught a sudden impression of argent light, of a storm of
multifurled wings, of a sound like thunder and then he was gone.<p>

I awoke to find that I'd put myself to bed, that it was half past
eleven and that I had an excruciating hangover. I called in sick from
my bedside phone, then I showered and went downstairs for a coffee.  I
took my mug into the lounge and that was when I saw that the Book was
still there.  My heart sank as I saw the refutation of my hope (though
I had known it to be vain) that I had dreamt the previous evening.  I
collapsed into a chair, put the coffee down near me, then I took up
the Book.<p>

Closed, it was like an ordinary hardback, save for the irridescent
page edges.  I also noticed the profusion of tape markers sticking up
from the tops of the pages.  I vaguely recalled Lucifer working at
great speed to put these translucent tabs in.<p>

I opened the book at random, the pages seemed to flutter like wings
before settling.  The page was, of course, incomprehensible.  It
consisted of a page of text in a script which looked somewhat like
Arabic.  I closed the Book and drank from my coffee.  As I drank, I
began to remember some of the things Lucifer had said.<p>

The Book had what Lucifer called an uncountable infinity of pages;
he'd tried to explain how there could be different sizes of infinity,
but I hadn't really been able to grasp the idea.  The pages I could
read were also infinite in number, according to him, but they formed a
set "of measure zero".  I supposed I would have to read some
mathematics.  In order that I'd be able to find pages that I could
read, he'd marked "a good many of them" with the tapes that now stuck
out of the top of the Book.  "That's not everything," he'd said, "but
you'll never read all of even these. You can start at any page I've
marked and turn pages for ever without ever reaching the next tape. If
you take a tape out and close the Book then it's gone for ever.  Use
that gift with care."<p>

I opened the Book at the first tape.  Before me lay the title page of
Borges' <cite>Labyrinths</cite>.  Lucifer evidently had a sense of
humour.  I reread `The Library in Babel' and received the shocking
insight that even that world&#173;filling archive would take up almost
no space in the Book.  I began to grasp, intuitively, the size of the
object before me, and the meanness of the territory open to me.  I put
the Book down and drank from my coffee again.  It had gone cold.<p>

I took a holiday from work in order that I could read the Book more
thoroughly.  It only took a few days before I could think of it as an
ordinary object (at least most of the time) and I soon began to find
many interesting things in its maze of pages.<p>

One of the first things I noticed was that Lucifer seemed to have
selected the marked pages with me in mind.  Wherever I opened the Book
I found something of interest.  I took to attaching numbered sellotape
labels to the ends of Lucifer's labels and in that way I began to
build up an index.  Lucifers labels themselves resembled translucent
sellotape, though they were much stronger, and also much tougher than
normal tape.  I found I could remove them from the Book only with some
effort, but that I could stick them down again easily.<p>

The pages themselves were thoroughly resistant to damage. Over the
years I've had the Book now, I've found I cannot tear or cut them,
mark them or soil them, either with liquid or with heat.  I can mark
new pages with a simple bookmark, but there is little point since I've
never found an unmarked page I can understand.<p>

During my second week of study I came upon a chronicle of
newspapers. The marked page picked out the cover page of the Times for
January 1st of that year.  Tuning back took me further into the past,
forward took me nearer to the present.  I began to turn the pages
eagerly. I had found early on that pushing across the block of pages
from right to left brought up the next page of the Book.  At least,
the page was next in the sense that prose read naturally from one side
to the other; I was never sure that there were not more pages furled
within the thickness of the one I had lifted.  Any attempt to skip
forward through the Book led into unknown territory.<p>

Thus I wearily turned through several thousands of pages before I
reached the Times of that day.  It was of course correct in every
detail.  By now I was excited and not a little fearful: could
tomorrow's newspapers really be in?  I had to look, and the pages were
indeed there.  I read through that day's papers, then put a bookmark
into that page and pressed on.  After a while, the stories looked as
meaningless as those in the newspapers of a year ago.  Two things
occurred to me about the chronicle: firstly that it could make me
rich, and secondly that it was dangerous.  The riches were easy, I
simply filled in my Pools coupon using the results of matches yet to
be played.  Waiting to win, knowing that I had already won, was very
strange - like waiting for exam results when you know you've done
well, but want to be sure - yet I did win, and thus I became a
millionaire.  I invested the money prudently, and I've lived
comfortably ever since.<p>

The danger was the knowledge of the future. Since the Book transcended
our world, it made sense that it should hold this information.  What
was paradoxical was that I should know it.  Knowing a prediction in
the Book I could set out to change it.  In practice this would be
difficult - the chronicle contained only National, British newspapers
(again leading me to wonder if there were pages within the pages) -
but if I did so, what would change?  Would the Book alter to reflect
the new world, or would I find myself in a world where the Book was
wrong?  Perhaps all these possibilities were already inscribed,
somewhere in the Book.  Whatever the case, I didn't want the
responsibility.  Though I held back several times, eventually I
removed the marker for the chronicle.<p>

As that strange first year wore on, the Book took over more and more
of my life.  After my pools win, I left my job in order to study the
Book in earnest.  I became obsessive about cataloguing what I found.
I made indices which grew almost to rival the Book itself in length
and complexity.  As time passed, I saw less and less of my friends and
family.<p>

But as these outer parts of my life grew smaller, so the inside of the
Book seemed to grow ever larger.  I found, in several places,
histories of events in our past.  These would recount the event from
the view of an important figure, then from another, then another until
the history reached those whose lives were hardly touched at all.  I
found maps, in seemingly infinite descending sequence - once I even
found one which converged on my town, my street, my house - in ever
more obsessive detail.<p>

There were galleries of portraits, each picture had a photographic
realism; I had the feeling that the most powerful microscope could
never exhaust the resolution of these images.  There were libraries in
every subject, exhaustively indexed within the Book.  I read all I
could hold of lost works of great literature, and later, of
mathematics, as I sought to understand the concepts needed to describe
the Book.<p>

There were also dark things in the Book. There was a catalogue of
crimes and their perpetrators. Each crime - many were quite vile - was
analysed closely.  The list seemed to have no end.  There was
pornography in the Book. Every possible act was described, and
graphically pictured.  I treasured this for some time, even after
(perhaps especially after) I began to recognise some of the women
pictured.  Later, I removed the marker, with a mixture of sorrow and
relief.  The potential for blackmail only struck me several years
after that.  Christmas brought me to my senses.  I noticed, at last,
that my friends had gone, that I did little but eat, sleep, and read
the Book, and that though I had resources of money, my life had become
a shambles.  I resolved to improve myself, and I made a new start.  I
moved to York, a city I had always loved, and bought a large house
there.  I became involved in the work of several charities and
societies (initially to make me stay away from the Book, later purely
for the happiness it brought me) and gradually made new friends in
these circles.  I re&#173;established contact with my family and life
slowly became more normal again.<p>

I have continued in basically that manner for nearly forty years.  Of
course, I am somewhat less active now, as the years begin to take
their toll of me.  For at least two decades I was perfectly happy in
my life, but as the years passed, one problem worried my mind ever
more seriously: what if God wanted the Book back?  At first I thought
there was nothing that could be done - if God wanted the Book then He
would get it from me, by one means or another.  But with more
consideration, I came to see that, if the Book was truly what it said
it was, then I was in the Book, and that, if I knew God's plan for me
then I would no longer be constrained by it.<p>

Thus I began a search for the records of my life, a search for my
future history.  This proved to be difficult.  I had a rough idea
where in the Book I might find such a record, since over the years I
had come to associate certain parts of the Book with certain types of
knowledge.  Unfortunately, the markers accumulated about a point close
to where I wished to search - these points of accumulation were a
necessary consequence of the fact that Lucifer had marked infinitely
many pages in the Book.<p>

It took me over fifteen years of diligent work to find the marker that
I needed.  Even then, I resolved not to look more than a day ahead of
myself, lest I alter the facts of my future in such a way that I would
no longer be forewarned of God's time of action.  Last night though,
after three agonizing years of living in my own shadow, I found the
page I sought.  It read, "After the lights failed, Mr. Hume rose,
fetched a torch from the kitchen and began to descend to the cellar to
investigate the fusebox.  As he went down the cellar stairs, the torch
broke, plunging him into darkness.  He lost his footing in the dark,
and was killed by the impact of the fall onto the cellar floor."  This
was the last entry; it had to be God's way of getting me out of the
way.  Even if it wasn't, I had nothing to lose since the article
foretold my death.  The next night - the fatal night - came, and I
found myself sat in my lounge, reading the Book and waiting for the
lights to fail.<p>

Suddenly they died, I felt the usual sense of surprise that the Book
was true (the constant prediction of the future still astonished me,
even after three years) and then the thought struck me that I should
go and check the fusebox.  I had never tried to kick against my future
before, but I knew that if I got up now then I would die in the
cellar.  I sat still.  Time passed; I was frozen in my chair by the
sense of danger in any action save inaction.<p>

I heard the key turn in the front door, I wondered briefly who was
there, then there was a tremendous crash as I heard the it flung open.
I turned to see brilliant light shining through the chinks around the
door leading to the hall.  Then that door too banged open and I saw a
shining man enter the room.  The light emanated from all around him,
throwing the room into sharp relief, black and white.  He was tall,
and handsome.  As he moved his head to look in my direction I got a
sense of every face I had ever known being contained in that one face.
He was beautiful and terrible, young and old, male and female.  Even
if I had been able to move (for I was quite frozen with fear), I could
not have looked away from that face.  Then he spoke, and the voice was
much more than just waves in the air.  "Mr. Hume, I have come for my
Book." I picked it up from the table and began to pass it to Him - I
felt that I could not do otherwise - when I remembered that I had
escaped death only minutes before.  I snatched the Book back towards
me.  I rose and shouted at Him, "You would have killed me for this
Book!"<p>

"I would have allowed your tendencies to put you in mortal
danger. There is a distinction.  I am no longer allowed just to kill
you.  It is part of the agreement."  A wave of pain flashed across the
holographic face.  He walked across the room and sat down on the
settee, His light became less bright as He spoke again.  "I shall
state my position to you clearly Mr. Hume.  You have brought your
world to a crisis by not dying just then.  I cannot take the Book from
you by force, because it violates the agreement I made with Humanity -
you included, Mr. Hume - on a cross two thousand years ago.  I cannot
take it by fiat, because I limited my omniscience to give your race
free will.  Suggestion failed a moment ago, and it will not work now
if it did not work then.  I am left with only one option; I will allow
you to decide what you want to do.  But let me first explain the
consequences.  If I take the Book, things will fall back into their
proper order.  Your universe evolves according to a grand plan.  It
furthers my ends.  If I take the Book, your race will prosper - I
guarantee it.  If I take the Book, every being in these myriad worlds
will eventually come to know me and to love me.  There will be life
eternal for all, love eternal for all.  If, on the other hand, you
keep the Book, what do you gain?  A troublesome burden of knowledge
for you and your race - there is much in there that is deeply
dangerous to you all.  Even if you guard the Book well, Mr. Hume, how
do you know your successor will do so?  Worse than that burden though,
is that I will cause myself to forget your race and that Book.  You
will be alone.  Your universe will have only a dark, mechanical future
as it slowly winds down towards maximum entropy.  No&#173;one will be
remembered after that final death." His words rained down on me like
hammer blows to the soul, yet I had made a decision and even He could
not dissuade me.  "No," I replied, I will not give you the Book."<p>

"As you wish, Mr. Hume. I see I cannot move you."  He rose and walked
out, into the garden; I followed on behind.  As we reached the middle
of the lawn, He turned.  He looked sorrowful now, and pitying.
"Farewell, Mr. Hume," He said at last.  We embraced then, as father
and son.  He departed quietly, shading gently into the textures of the
garden around Him, until He had disappeared.<p>

Momentarily, I was sad for what we had lost.  But, as I walked back to
the house, I felt the ineffable joy of the freed man rising within
me.<p>



<hr><a name="cedricks"><h2>Cedrick</h2></a>

<H3>Simon Pick</H3>

This is all that remains of an early Old Low Saxon poem relating the
heroic adventures and death of one Cedrick, one of the heroic
chieftains who formed the staple of common Germanic heroic legend.
The sole text is in a fourteenth century Old Saxon manuscript
identifiable on palaeographic grounds as coming from Wilmersbach; in
the seventeenth century it passed into Kappersen's possession and was
rebound by him in a volume also containing a partial text of the Old
Low Saxon <cite>Platypus and Nightingale</cite> and three early
redactions of Ermarnius Stercor's treatise on patrician computistics -
the manuscript is therefore of uniform interest throughout and its
neglect has obviously been keenly felt by students of comparative
Germanic literature.  In the seventeenth century the poem is known to
have been complete - in his <cite>Notitia</cite> Kappersen refers to
the ending as "hoblich ond maeneregeschaft" - but because of the
accidental neglect already mentioned no transcript was ever made.  The
manuscript was rediscovered by Hoten in the early nineteenth century
and turned over to study at the Bonn Museum of
Altgermanische&#173;Artkunsthistorischschrieben where on arrival an
undercurator spilt his coffee over it and in the subsequent cleaning
procedure roughly 14,000 lines were erased.  The tragedy of this loss
cannot be overemphasized.  As to the story, we can only conjecture.
Kethrikr, his Old Norse counterpart, appears in the Poetic Edda in
association with Heremothr and Sigemundr; he appears to have been
their contemporary and appears to have received presents from them,
but was never invited to their beer&#173;drinkings for obscure
reasons.  He is mentioned in Bandifots Saga.  In the Old English
<cite>Widsith</cite> he rules over the Sceaftings and is killed by a
worm, one of three such heroes.  It must be admitted his name is a
philological puzzle.  By reference to Germanic linguistics alone it
cannot be etymologised, but a Cerdic son of Elesa is attested as one
of the early invaders of Britain in the Anglo&#173;Saxon Chronicle and
this name is cognate with the well&#173;attested Old Welsh Ceretig.
When was Germanic legend infected with Celtic heroes?  Dumezil has
suggested that he could be common Indo&#173;European, citing as
evidence the Vedic god of sibling rivalry, Kanitichayama, but his
arguments are too complex to be summarised here and have anyway been
stringently attacked by K H Jackson in &Eacute;tudes Celtiques 14 for
1978.  Interested parties can look this up for themselves.<p>

Obviously in this translation I have made no attempt to reproduce the
cadences of Old Low Saxon verse, which is rigidly formulaic, sometimes
to the point of obscurity.  I have rather attempted clarity, but
nevertheless the translation is worthless if some of the vigour and
spirit of the poem has not been retained.  Any rendering can -
inevitably - only be a pale shadow of the fine original.  I only hope
my poor efforts will inspire the reader to reach for an Old Low Saxon
grammar, an edition of the poem, and from there make his own advances.
I have myself derived many hours of pleasure from the poem and do not
doubt that the effort involved will bring its own reward.

<h3>Cedrick</h3>

<blockquote>... lashed to the mast.<br>

Hard in battle became the war&#173;fired spume&#173;leader<br>

Mighty in excellent vigorousness to the folk of the leaf&#173;tree<br>

When hateful ones became storming.<br>

With iron&#173;girt thighs he bent to the battle&#173;bow,<br>

Lifted the war&#173;tree<br>

Ripped from the earth the shaking over&#173;branch,<br>

Brandished it in the air, made a speech,<br>

Podbod's son, mighty&#173;man of stoutness and vigilance,<br>

Sent fine graces to the the demon&#173;enemies, uttered this word,<br>

"Lo, while adorned in battle&#173;trappings I stand here,<br>

And am not at all much afraid,<br>

I will not render you a hair's width of the gleaming earth<br>

But rather with my mighty battle&#173;strength,<br>

Which is famed among far lands and among my people<br>

And also among my wife, gold adorned and eager for wine,<br>

Will defend and protect from you, hairy and over&#173;zealous
carrion&#173;feeders<br>

Who are not&#173;much welcome in the homeland of the Shaftings.<br>

I will get you ale&#173;sorrow in the large cities of your
friends,<br>

But not more than it is necessary<br>

For the open&#173;armed burrower of wave tidings."<br>

So mightily said the gold&#173;adorned one<br>

As he gaped with words before the battle&#173;drawn war&#173;array<br>

And his spirit surged altogether very much<br>

When it became necessary...<br>

... indeed...<br>

But not without...<br>

...<br>

... which astonished his enemies to a great extent<br>

And left them with little help,<br>

If the truth be told, as I have heard men say often and frequently<br>

And not without considerable thought.  For when the poet<br>

Lifts up the hero's thunder to the pleasure of many<br>

In the antler&#173;adorned hall of the people's defender,<br>

Then many are pleased and stop<br>

In the beer&#173;taking for the pleasure of their senses<br>

And also for their ears from the black&#173;thighed old man of great
lettering.<br>

So Cedrick said as he shook the war&#173;tree.  And this was not
all...<br>

...<br>

... with much...</blockquote>

<hr><a name="duelmatt"><h2>Duel</h2></a>

<H3>Matthew Reid</H3>

The camp in the valley was cheerful with the light of the fire, and
the smell of pheasant cooking.  It was a pleasant evening, a needed
respite from the terrible events of the last few months.  The prince
had gone far, through dangerous wilds and many perils, and now felt
his mission might just succeed.  The tyrant lord's forces were far
behind now, and barring evil chance he should now be able to reach his
country's hope, and then it would be his task to win these strangers
as allies.<p>

The prince sat by the fire and talked with the six picked men of his
house&#173;guard, six of the twenty that had started on this
journey. On the other side of the fire, alienated by his power and his
aura of independence and self&#173;sufficiency, was the greatest
wizard of the light.  Nerlam, he called himself, but wizards rarely
give their true names.<p>

Night fell and they went to the tent.  The first two watches passed
without incident.  In the next watch, one or two hours after midnight,
a shadow was seen moving along the path from which they had come.  It
grew closer, until at last it said in a firm, yet strangely inhuman
voice, "I am a servant of the one true lord. Give up your prince and
the ret of you may depart.  Refuse and I shall blast you into dust
with my sorcery."<p>

The whole camp had been awoken by then, and Nerlam it was who answered
the challenge.  "You do not know to whom it is you speak.  I am
Nerlam, and if you want to remain on this earth at all, you must swear
by all the gods of light, and all the gods of dark, and all the gods
of this world, and all the gods of the next, never to have any
dealings with men again.  I charge you to surrender your powers and to
go and hide in some dark hole until your death, else I will fight you,
and I will destroy you as I have destroyed so many of your kind
before.  Now swear."<p>

"I will not go.  I have looked towards this day for many years.  I
shall fight you, and destroy you unless you yield to my master."<p>

"I will not fight you here and now.  It would do me little good
killing the prince in the backwash of magic unleashed by your
destruction, as it would do you little good to have the victory
against me, only to be slain by the release of those magics held bound
to my life.  Instead, I offer you a bargain.  If you promise the
prince and his men to leave freely, and never to hinder them again,
then I will promise that you will not be harmed by my magics after my
death.  You may also take all my belongings not destroyed in the
fight.  It will take some time for me to unbind the magic, so I ask
that you wait until dawn before we begin our duel."<p>

"I swear by all the gods of the dark, and all the gods of the light,
and all the gods of this world, and all the gods of the next, that as
you keep your part of the bargain, so shall I keep mine."<p>

"I swear by all the gods of the light, and all the gods of the dark,
and all the gods of this world, and all the gods of the next that I
shall keep to this bargain.  Now go, and leave me quiet to perform my
magics."<p>

"I will meet you here at dawn, wizard."  On that, the shadow withdrew,
though it remained in sight of the camp.<p>

"My prince, you must make all haste to strike camp and continue your
journey.  You must be at least a mile away by dawn, else the magics
are likely to kill you.  Take this scroll.  On it is a map of the
route you must take.  I have marked on what I know of the hazards
along the way.  Go with fortune, my prince."<p>

"You fear that this one might defeat you?"<p>

"There is an element of lottery in all such battles, and prudence is a
virtue."  The prince thought he heard a catch in Nerlam's voice with
those words.  He turned and signalled his men to leave ahead of him.
"What is this thing?  What makes it mightier than all those others you
have defeated?"<p>

"What is mightier in it.  The courage to call a bluff, that is all.
It is only courage."<p>

The wizard turned away.  "What is the matter?" asked the prince,
catching Nerlam's shoulder, and was shocked to see a tear running down
the cheek of one who seemed so far from such things.<p>

"Go away.  Just go and leave me."<p>

"What is wrong?"<p>

The wizard turned and in an angry voice snapped, "I said leave!"<p>

There followed a silence, then in a soft, sad voice, "I am not strong
enough.  I should not speak, but I find I must," and in firmer tones,
"Promise that you never tell anyone or anything what I shall
reveal."<p>

"I promise," and then, feeling something more was required, "By all
the gods of the light, and all the gods of the dark, and all the gods
of this world, and all the gods of the next, I promise."<p>

"I am nothing but a joke by the wizards of the light.  It takes at
least seventy years to learn to be a really good wizard, and the
spells that keep you young and healthy are, are too corrupting to use.
So all those best able to do good are physically incapable of walking
a mile, or running up a flight of stairs, while the people who can
travel on missions such as this can all be slaughtered by any
half&#173;way competent enemy wizard.  So what do they do?  They make
me.  A man comes to them with ideals and a desire to learn, and finds
he can't manage the simplest conjuring.  He then suddenly seems to get
the hang of it, and progresses at an unprecedented rate, because,
known only to him and a very few others, all the magic is being done
for him.  They let him fight a few illusions in very public places,
and spread tales of other deeds of his in far off lands, and in a
while he becomes their weapon.  He learns maps, and politics, and goes
out on quests, defeating hordes of monsters without fighting at all.
I have helped this world as best I am able, and as that is what I
asked to do, I should not feel bitter.  Yet it hurt to have to carry
the weight of my persona around.  It hurt never to be my true self, to
never be close to anyone, to always be the perfect wizard.  At first I
walked in constant dread of this day, then I started almost to believe
in my own invulnerability as monsters melted away before me, like
shadows in the sun.  And now, at last, one fights. Farewell, my
prince, and walk with luck."<p>

"Farewell, bravest servant."<p>

With that, the prince turned and walked off into the night, while the
wizard prepared for battle.<p>



<hr><a name="vampired"><h2>The Vampire Desire</h2></a>

<H3>Simon Pick</H3>

Dirk was watching late&#173;night TV with the sound turned down so
that he heard the faint scratching at the window which he dreaded, but
when he finally dared turn his head to test the living room window it
was a shock to see Jenny, white&#173;faced, staring back into his eyes
from the darkness beyond.  She was scraping on the window&#173;pane
with her fingers.  He couldn't turn away from her stare, but from the
edges of his eyes he could see that outside there was nothing but
shades of black and white.  The violent nail&#173;polish she had worn
had somewhere been flaked off.<p>

Jenny scraped some more.  Her mouth moved.  The window's glass did not
frost before it.<p>

Dirk sat in his chair.  He stared into her eyes.  He appeared to have
no reflection on the window.<p>

Dirk got up from the chair, eyes still transfixed, never aware of the
shivering in his muscles as he stepped towards the moonface outside,
her eyes fathomless, like two great craters, like the blank surfaces
of puddles.  He was frightened across and athwart the structure of his
whole body, as if he had been bodily dropped to land flat on concrete,
but he now stood before her at the window, stood without responding to
the scrape, scrape of the long fingernails on the glass, looked away
from the stiff eyes to the mouth.  His body was tense.  Speech was
impossible.<p>

He wanted to run, but he did not dare move further.<p>

He looked at the fingernails.  It was horrible to see the fingers
squirm, each shift shadowing the clefts in her knuckles into a new and
occult pattern.  He looked at her face again.  Her expression had not
changed.<p>

"Let me in, Dirk," she said.  "It's very cold."<p>

The size of the living room and its yellow lights made it seem a very
cold place too.  He shivered, and still could not speak.<p>

"I've been out here a long time, since you left me on the common," she
wheedled, her hands now going to clasp over her crotch.  "Let me in,
let me in."<p>

"Let me see your teeth, Jenny."<p>

"Open the door and let me in.  I'll make you a cup of hot chocolate.
I just want to sit and watch television."<p>

"Show me your teeth."  Dirk's breath caught.  His voice started on a
squeak.  "You have to let me see it."<p>

She opened her mouth.  Her long canines shot out like missiles from a
silo, the pure white gleaming bright against the muddy shadowed
blood&#173;red of the mouth in her poor face sullied by the night
gloom.  Her eyes flexed and flared strangely, her hands were at her
sides, were banged like paws on the window, were at her cheeks.
Suddenly she stretched in her splendour, white gown flapping, arms
wild, mouth clawing for something to bite on in the insubstantial
night air - a vampire's bride revealed, she was beautiful and
glorious, with eternal life embodied in her sterile power; a promise
of ecstasy, of extremity, of an uttermost plunge into desire and Dirk
wanted her more than anything in the world, for her to own him and
taste him and plunge teeth into his gushing vitality and drain and
drain and drain until he was nothing left and was like her too: a
vampire, a hunter, a night&#173;walking blood&#173;feeder thrown off
from Death's oblivion like jetsam shot out from an impenetrable
incomprehensible spinning maelstrom; but he did not dare, because he
wanted to live and he feared murder and death and everything was still
within his lit sitting&#173;room.  He began to tremble; by an effort
of will he stopped.<p>

Jenny was calm again.<p>

Her moon face was placid, her fangs the subtlest of enticements on her
lips, her fingers white blobs on the glass.<p>

Then they twisted to claws and again, soft, soft, they began to
scrape.<p>

"I can't let you in," said Dirk, "I can't let you in, please go away,
please, oh please."  His arms shook again and he wanted to cry.  "Go
and take someone else."<p>

"Don't you want me, Dirk?  You always did, you know" - she leaned
further forward - "and now you can have me, Dirk, if you let me
in."<p>

Suddenly Dirk leapt up and pulled the curtains to, one then the other
skating along the curtain rail to hide the vision outside.  He leapt
back, appalled that he had had the nerve to lessen the distance
between them.  What could she have done to him? but smashed with her
vampire arms through the brittle window when he was in reach? passed
intangible through the wall, a jellified breeze, and continued perhaps
to mesh her filthy atoms with his own and settle in his soul that way?
If he had trembled before, the sudden action had left him shaking now,
his arms weak and head dizzy, his watery muscles jiggling sweat from
out their pores.  He couldn't move closer again.  He couldn't move
away, in case <em>she</em> could sense it, in case it would stimulate
her to action.  He stood where he was.  Fear tensed his body for
action, but terror of the result - any result - made it impossible for
him to move.<p>

To his right were the French windows.  He had drawn no curtains over
them.<p>

He almost howled as he lunged in terror for the curtains to the french
windows.  He yanked the first halfway across, then leapt to pull the
second, never daring to look out to see if she had shifted her
position to stare in through the wall of glass, always with his eyes
on the aluminium floor runnel in the terror of uncertainty.  If he
looked and saw her, the horror would strike him dead, he felt.  If he
looked into her eyes, wouldn't this transfix him with death's secret
dart?<p>

Now he stood by the french windows in a pool of cold air felt even
through the curtains.  The sweat on his body breathed away.  He could
feel the pumping of his heart as it battered contrariwise against his
own pained panting.  Vampires didn't pant.  Vampires didn't breathe,
the still night did it for them.  They shaded seamlessly into the
dark.  There was a vampire out beyond, though she was cocooned from
him by curtains.  The room's artificial light seemed all the more
yellow for its isolation in there with him, the furniture not warmed
in its low glow.  Dirk was still panting, still weak, still agonised.
Where was she?  What was she doing?  She wanted to get in - had she
moved from where he had first seen her, or was she still at the side
window, willing him to let her in, drawing strength into her
immobility against his weak will?  Was that her plan, to wait until he
had to let her in, the own terror of his will working on itself on her
behalf?  That would be the most awful plan of all.  That would be the
worst.<p>

If it was the worst he had to know.<p>

He grasped one curtain on the french window.  The hammer of his heart
drove harder and harder as he inched his face forward, trying to mask
is movements by their imperceptibility.  When his cheek touched
material, he held there for a moment in his last security, then with a
quick flip pulled it back enough to peer out into the dark with one
eye.<p>

He stared straight into the eyes of the vampire, two inches away on
the other side of the glass.<p>

He screamed and leapt back, stumbling into the sofa and half kicking
further into the room.  With remarkable leg extension he scrambled
over the sofa, always looking at the shut curtains, fearing lest in an
orgy of waving arms and broken glass dead Jenny should come bursting
into the room and seize him, kiss him, kill him.  Would she come?
Would she knock?  Was she still there, looking, seeing through the
curtains as if they were no more than the clothes of a man indicating
his underlying shape and presence, seeing from outside in the darkness
his light&#173;bulb targetted heart.  The whole lit room was a shining
target for vampires.<p>

He stood in the middle of the room, his hands twisting in fear.  He
stood on one leg, ready to run.  His foot rubbed up the back of his
other leg, then down. He could not think for terror.  What should he
do?  Where was she?  If she was by the french windows, could he look
out of the side window and not see her? If he saw her out of the side
window, waiting, would he die?  Or would it be worse if he did not see
her out of the side window, if he did not know where she was?  Or
would it be worse if he looked out of the side window and did not see
her and then she came round from the french windows, round the corner,
gliding perhaps, supported and drifting on the breath of the breathing
night, coming round the corner to claim her own?  Were there worse
things than dying instantly on seeing a vampire immediately when you
opened the curtains of your side window?  There were.<p>

"Where are you?" he tried to scream, but his mouth didn't move and it
came out a whisper.<p>

He waited in the middle of the room.<p>

Where was she?<p>

Waiting made him more terrified.  He had to find a plan.  He turned
and ran for the sitting room door, opened it onto the unlit hall.  In
the darkness he ran for the stairs, upstairs.  He ran the paces along
the corridor to his mother's bedroom.  In the darkness of his mother's
bedroom he lunged over the bed and pulled open the door of the chunky
wooden bedside cabinet, the one with the carvings he'd thought he'd
seen moving at night when he was a child.  Inside was a cardboard box.
He pulled out the cardboard box and sat with it on the bed.  His eyes
adjusted.<p>

The knowledge of her presence downstairs - waiting by the sitting room
shut out from the light - was the nag in his mind that made his throat
dry and his hands tremble as he fumbled with the contents of the box.
He did not dare switch the light on in here, or anywhere in the house.
The curtains were not closed in here.  If she should show at this
second&#173;story window, peering in from the air, he felt he would
die.  That would be to kind of her.  She would wait for where she knew
he was - the sitting room.  And vampires couldn't levitate.<p>

The darkness of the night and the darkness of the room were one.
Above the black horizon, stars floated in it.  Moonlight and
foreknowledge helped him recognise the objects in the box.  Out came
his mother's hand&#173;held hair dryer from the seventies in it's own
decaying box; when he threw it aside it fell out onto the floor.  Out
came a box of old curlers.  Out came a solid sheaf of useless
magazines featuring country houses, and at the bottom of the box among
the real junk was his mother's crucifix, huge and plastic, a heavy
relic of ancient enthusiasm.  When he pulled it out, it was heavy in
his hand like a club.  The plastic was smooth textured, but at the
finials and at the wide, ridged base decoration disturbed it into a
surf of curls and curlicues, agitated ornamentation to match its
aggressive sanctity.  He ran his fingertips up and down it.  He hefted
it.  He was still frightened.  He turned and made his way out into the
corridor and downstairs.<p>

With every step he took down he felt his heart in his breast jolt
harder.  He held the cross out rigidly before him in case uninvited
vampires leapt out from the swaying shadows.  His arm wavered with the
weight.  He trod down, step by step, to the bottom of the stairs and
there stopped.  He could not conceivably carry on.  He would stay
there all night - or for as long as she would let him.  He would stay
here, in fear, crucifix up, for the rest of his life.<p>

It was her fault.  She had gone off with the tall man.<p>

He willed his stubborn legs to stump onwards to the door to the
sitting room, under which he could see shining the tell&#173;tale
light.  Once at the door his fear became unreal - its magnitude was
too great to perceive.  He burst open the door and leapt into the
middle of the room.  "I've got a crucifix," he shouted.  "You can't
catch me."  He jammed it down in the centre of the coffee table, not
breaking the glass top but sending an ashtray skittering.  He rubbed
it to and fro on the glass table, emphasizing its presence.  "Do you
hear me?  I'll never invite you in and now I've got a crucifix you
can't bother me any more.  You know that's the way it is."  Oh, she'd
see the last of him now.  Now he'd got her measure.  Nothing was
happening.  He yelled again for the release.<p>

In the room he could see nothing but the furniture.  The curtains were
as he'd left them, closed.<p>

She would be out there somewhere, waiting.<p>

Now he had a crucifix.<p>

Was she round the back of the house, at an unlit part where he
couldn't see what was happening?  Was she climbing in an unmarked
window?  Would she seize him from behind, sudden and strong, giving
him no chance to raise his protection but heaving him into the cold
hall away from the light and there suck blood, feed on him, do as
vampires desired?<p>

He didn't know.<p>

He noticed his sweat was sticking his jumper to his back.  His mouth
went dry yet again, his chest was tight yet again, he needed to
scratch his right armpit.  Where was she?<p>

He couldn't stay like this all night.<p>

In a moment of tense daring he nipped round the side of the sofa to
the curtains of the french window.  The movement was more horrifying
than standing in indecision, for standing, agonised, he was not
calling her attention.  She would wait.  Movement provoked.<p>

He stood by the curtains of the french windows.<p>

Heart pounding, he took hold of them at the join (would she reach
through the glass to bite his fingers?).  Suddenly he pulled them
apart.<p>

He did not die instantly.  She was not waiting.  She was not there,
there was only the black night - the huge black breadth of the cold
windows.<p>

She must be by the side window!  She would know he had pulled back the
curtains of the french windows and would glide round to stare in at
him again, and that would be the most terrifying thing of all, to see
her move, to see uncountenanceable her levitate without effort on the
breath of the breathing night to confront him who she wanted and would
get, move in body in the infinite black world beyond to stare and
stare and stare, most terrifying of all; and so, incredibly fast, he
leapt panicky to the side window and seized the curtains, pulling them
apart so hard he ripped one halfway from the rail to expose her in her
terrible presence before she could move round to see him - he pulled
apart the curtains - <p>

And there was nothing there.  Again the black window spilled cold into
the lit room, there was no vampire in the night.<p>

He backed into the middle of the room.  He stared from one window to
the other - no vampire in one, no vampire in either: two black windows
in a yellow lit sitting room.  In a panic leap, not looking, he leapt
back and slammed shut the door he had come in by and not closed.  It
banged.  He was backed up against its shut security, looking from one
window to the other, waiting for her to appear at either and kill him
with a single look, but please God, just to appear and not glide into
view, because seeing her move would be most terrifying of all.  She
did not appear.<p>

Would she elsewhere break into the unlit and unprotectable house?  Was
she even now stealing up on the door his body was moulded to, to smash
it in and smash him in with it, and then leap on his shattered body
and gorge in the blood from its multiple gushing wounds, a veritable
orgy of unassuageable hunger gulping satisfaction from his
ever&#173;giving fount?  That was not fair!  She could not be haunting
another side of the house, a window where he was not.  She was drawn
to the light like a night&#173;moth.  She was magnetised to him, she
could not go anywhere else.  She should be here!  She should be
here!<p>

He went to press his face against the waiting windows - stood up
against the night french windows as if to ease into their cold
blackness by osmosis, breath painlessly clouding on the glass.  (Was
she waiting round the corner?)  Up this close, the room's lights did
not drive the blackness deeper, he could see out to greater depth.
What could he see?  A rustling garden, hidden trees, screened bushes
all under an ignorant sky and down there, at the bottom of the garden
by the compost heap where scraggy roughage half hid the
gap&#173;toothed boggy fence which didn't quite block off some unknown
corner of next door's arbour - a flash of white, dirtied by the gloom,
a tentative half&#173;figure moving one way or another; and then she
was gone, and he could see her no more.  She had deserted him.<p>

At the heart of the small, vital maelstrom of life the beast of dead
love screamed for its own regret.<p>

"Jenny," his mouth moved against the pane, "Jenny."  The low priestess
of the tall man on the common was gone, and he had been cheated of his
haunting.  "She should have waited.  I could have waited her out.  In
the morning I would have been free."  He returned to the table and the
hated cross, more solid than ever.  "This would have saved me."  Why
had she gone when she was so menacing?  Now he was fumbling with the
lock on the french windows, now sliding them back, now shifting out
into the cold night - on the patio his heart half apprehending that it
was a trap, that she would leap out from behind the ornamental
tree&#173;pot and seize him, murder him, terrorise him with the threat
of her living death. "Jenny, you've gone?" he called softly.  "Jenny,
am I safe from you?"  He abandoned the sitting&#173;room, light
redundantly still streaming from its windows, spurned crucifix hidden
on the table inside.  He moved out into the night, shadows gathering
around him.  "Jenny, I wouldn't have struggled much.  I had to protect
myself against you, but you needn't have worried.  Jenny... come
back."  His voice drifted off, carried away on night's breath.  "Come
back." Now he was beyond the range of vision, out of the light, and -
not swallowed by vampires, not visited by screaming terror but
silently absorbed - his voice and figure vanished into the black.<p>

<hr><a name="junkgare"><h2>Junk</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

Roger's bedside comp played a tinny but cheery tune at him and Roger
groaned, rolled over, stretched, and sat up, his head spinning in
twenty different directions.<p>

"Good morning, Roger&#173;babes," beamed the cheery comp, "It's
another beautiful day in Barbie City, the sun's shining, the
temperature is a balmy twenty&#173;two degrees and the humidity is
seventy&#173;three percent!  Rise and shine, sleepy&#173;head, you're
due for work in eighty&#173;five minutes, the byways are projected at
one hundred and twelve percent of capacity by eight&#173;thirty three
this morning, and you have six thousand five hundred and twenty mail
messages.  Netnews reports on its morning edition that
ninety&#173;three percent of Citizens would rather eat a donut than
have sex and the Minister for Offspring has once again urged for
calm..."<p>

Roger let the machine babble on, poured some nutra&#173;gloop from the
pot beside his futon and sipped.  The drug helped to clear the fuzz
from his brain. "Give me the run&#173;down on my mail," he said.<p>

"Five thousand nine hundred and twenty six junk messages eliminated on
a simple junk scan at level one," said the comp in its manly Biz
voice, "two hundred and seventy&#173;four passed the syntax check but
were caught by the semantic analyser at level two, three hundred and
twenty&#173;nine messages are subscribed newsfeeds and have been filed
for later perusal.  And there's a message from Michelle."<p>

"Gimme," said Roger.  It was so rare that he - or anyone - received a
real letter from a real person.  He suddenly remembered that he hadn't
seen Michelle for two weeks, and felt an instant pang of guilt.<p>

"My dearest Roger," said the comp in it's Michelle voice, "I got your
message last Kayday.  How nice to hear from you again!  I would have
sent this sooner, but you know how things are, it didn't seem, well...
Anyway, I was wondering if... well, perhaps you would like to come out
for dinner next Emday?  I thought that we could go to the Bistro Novo
out on Four thousand nine hundred and seventy&#173;sixth Boulevard, I
went there a month ago with Ella, you remember her?  Anyway the Bistro
Novo has full mechanical service and private booths, and the food is
utterly fabulous, the pancakes are just scrumptious, and the avocado
marzipan - it just explodes off your tongue!  And it's really
affordable.  So let me know - "<p>

"Stop!" cried Roger.  <em>The bastards</em>, he thought, <em>the
bastards.  Not content with deluging me with crap, day in, day out,
they have to ruin everything they touch with their slimy commercial
hands, they have to get at Michelle as well</em>.<p>

"There's only one language these people understand," he said.  "Comp,
get me the mail address of the Bistro Novo."<p>



<hr><a name="pentacon"><h2>Convention Report: Pentacon (Cambridge,
25th January 1992)</h2></a>

<h3>Barry Traish</h3>

It only took me 15 hours to get to Pentacon, so I was just in time for
the bar to open at 11am.  Well, it wasn't actually a con bar but the
pub next door to the site.  The University Centre (Gradpad) itself did
have a bar, but it was down a couple of floors and looked too
expensive.  Being so close and so well stocked with real ales, The
Mill next door was the far better choice.<p>

The con itself was small, probably due to the lack of publicity, but I
was asked, at the registration desk, to bring a team, just like
Uniconze; possibly this would swell numbers.  The programme was
surprisingly well attended because the programme items were
refreshingly interesting.  Sex in zero&#173;g was perhaps the most
novel (apparently it has now taken place but it involves velcro -
kinky!)  and Ken Campbell (the GoH) was the most amusing.  The
programme was obviously aimed at everyone having a good laugh and it
succeeded, although it was a little tiring by the end of the end of
the day.  After a long, fun day I didn't particularly need the
programme items to expand into one and a half hour slots and I
couldn't stand any more of the "Who's banana is it anyway?"  game.<p>

Finally 7.30 came around and we were kicked out of the con site and I
moved to the pub for more Old Growler.  Apart from wondering if my
lift back to Leeds had fallen into the Cam and died of Camfever, I had
fun and overall the con was a success for those that were there.<p>



<hr><a name="luconivy"><h2>Convention Report: Lucon IVy (Leeds,
February 21st&#173;23rd)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>
 
Lucon was very small, smaller even than Pentacon after the Live
Role&#173;Players had gone off to play Lazertag in the lecture
theatres.  And perhaps this was all to the best - the gamers had their
own space for their electric water pistols, rubber swords, laser guns,
chainmail bikinis, fur cloaks, camouflage jackets and balaclavas,
leaving the twenty of us who were left in peace and serenity.<p>

Consequently the programme was somewhat ill&#173;attended, and after a
few abortive attempts the serious items gave in to necessity and took
place in the bar.  Some of the items were reasonably successful
discussions, others wandered about in search of a point - par for the
course I suppose.<p>

The guest of honour, Gwyneth Jones, was an enthusiastic and perceptive
attender of panels and gave an excellent talk about the feminist
thinking behind her new novel, <cite>White Queen</cite>; Tom Shippey,
Professor of Literature at Leeds University, gave a half&#173;serious,
half humourous talk about the New Wave; Colin Greenland was unable to
attend for the second year running (due to illness this year) and was
replaced by the cheeky, chubby features of Charles Stross, boy
author.<p>

On Sunday the role&#173;players and fans finally got together to watch
Mary Gentle and Dean Wayland of the Fight School (a group set up to
teach a method of fighting competitively but safely with replica
medieval weapons) give a lecture and demonstration.<p>

In summary: quiet but fun nonetheless.<p>



<hr><a name="kindness"><h2>The Kindness of Women (J G
Ballard)</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

Only a science fiction writer could have written this book.  That
statement is a little controversial: the conventional wisdom is that
the semi&#173;autobiography of <cite>Empire of the Sun</cite> and
<cite>The Kindness of Women</cite> is a radical departure from
Ballard's sf novels.  But it seems to me that Ballard's concerns have
not changed.  His writing has always told us that Earth is the alien
planet, that the disaster has already happened, that `sanity' is
simply a fragile defense against an insane world.  A reader of
Ballard's sf will recognise the neuroses in this novel, the careful
mapping of the catatrophes we are living through and the narrator's
attempt to find a kind of fulfilment.<p>

<cite>The Kindness of Women</cite> is described on the cover as "the
sequel to <cite>Empire of the Sun</cite>" but that is not really the
case.  The story begins with Jim's childhood in Shanghai before the
war, and tells a different story of his imprisonment in the Lunghua
concentration camp by the Japanese: about his friendship with the
English girl Peggy, about his identification with his Japanese
captors: "There was something about the Japanese, their seriousness
and stoicism, that I admired.  One day I might join the Japanese Air
Force."<p>

In the event it is the Royal Air force that he joins - following his
identification with the disaster of the second world war Jim becomes
fascinated by the nuclear bombers of the third "which had already
started at Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and whose first installments were
the Berlin crisis and the Korean war. Somewhere over the skies of
Central Europe armaggeddon would wake from my dreams."<p>

Jim crashes out of the Air Force and returns to England where his life
is shattered when his wife dies in an accident.  The remainder of the
book describes his search for stability and happiness for himself and
his children, or a least (it is suggested) as much stability and
happiness as the twentieth century will allow.<p>

Two themes run through the book.  The first is Jim's obsession with
the nature of the catastrophe.  His identification with the Japanese
military and with the coming atomic holocaust I have described; later
he organises an extraordinary exhibition of car crashes and
(inevitably it seems) is involved in a car crash himself; he
experiments with LSD in a scene remiscent of Ballard's novel <cite>The
Crystal World</cite>: "Colours were floating free from the surfaces
around me.  The summer air had become a translucent prism and the
blades of uncut grass were touched by a layer of emerald light"; he
documents the takeover of reality by the media: "In many ways the
media landscape of the 1960s was a laboratory designed specifically to
cure me of all my obsessions.  Violence and pornography provided a kit
of desperate measures that might give some meaning both to Miriam's
death and the unnumbered victims of the war in China."<p>

The other theme is, of course, the kindness of women.  Jim seems to
evoke protective, mothering feelings in every woman he meets: Peggy in
the prisoner&#173;of&#173;war camp in Shanghai; Olga, his childhood
governess whom he meets at the premiere of the film of his novel about
his childhood in Shanghai (carefully, the film is never named); his
wife Miriam whom he met when he took part in a psychology experiment;
the junkie Sally; the neighbour who helped him through his depression
after his wife's death.  There is a lot of explicitly described sex,
but it all seems somehow mechanical, as though Jim could never get
over the woman he had dissected during his first year as a medical
student at Cambridge: "During my first term at University I saw her
naked every day, and I knew her more intimately than any other woman
in my life."<p>

How much of this book is accurate autobiography, how much invention?
Yes, Ballard was interned in Shanghai during the second world war but
he was not separated from his parents.  Yes, his wife died, but not
while they were on holiday in Spain.  Ballard has said that he wrote
the novel in this way because the changed events were psychologically
right, and perhaps this strange mixture of fact and fiction is the
only appropriate way to chronicle Jim's journey through the neuroses
of the twentieth century.<p>



<hr><a name="draculau"><h2>Dracula Unbound (Brian Aldiss)</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

What a contrast this novel makes with <cite>Frankenstein
Unbound</cite> (1973).  That earlier unbinding was a return by Aldiss
to the earliest, and one of the best sf novels (so Aldiss describes
<cite>Frankenstein</cite> in his <cite>Trillion Year Spree</cite>) to
find that the scientist and his monster remained a powerful metaphor
for scientific folly, and that Mary Shelley's gothic prose was the
perfect way to describe the fracturing of space&#173;time and the
narrator's personality.  "Though you seek to bury me," says the
monster at the last, "yet you will continuously resurrect me!  Once I
am unbound, I am unbounded!"  Marvellous stuff.<p>

But the new novel has none of the qualities of its prequel.  The
fatalism of the war that caused the breakup of time and space is
replaced with the enthusiastic American technological can&#173;do of
Joe Bodenland, inventor and millionaire tycoon.  The discovery in the
Utah desert of two fossilised human skeletons sixty&#173;five million
years old and contemporaneous with the last of the dinosaurs is
followed by the appearance of a `ghost&#173;train' which Bodenland
boards.  This turns out to be a time machine controlled by vampires
who evolved from flying dinosaurs and who now are massing in the past
and the future in preparation for the destruction of humanity with the
aid of the `F&#173;bomb'.<p>

Bodenland ends up at Bram Stoker's house in 1896 and he and the author
hit it off immediately and determine to set off and destroy the
vampires, which they do without much difficulty.  Science triumphs
over superstition, and without the slightest hint of irony Bodenland
destroys the time machine so that it can never endanger humanity
again.<p>

It seems that Dracula does not carry the same metaphorical meaning as
Frankenstein and his monster did; and while it is suggested that
Dracula represents the Victorian fear of sex and in particular
syphilis (of which Stoker died), Aldiss makes little attempt to
develop this theme.<p>

The plot suffers from inconsistencies, almost as if Aldiss was writing
faster than the speed of thought.  Joe Bodenland "once claimed he had
gone back in time to shake hands with Frankenstein," yet Dracula
Unbound is set 21 years prior to its prequel.  No doubt this is
another of the time paradoxes that scatter the plot - according to
Dracula, "time paradoxes are cancelled out by expenditure of energy,
just as energy can cut through the thickest metal." And certainly
there is a good deal of energy to the writing, but no amount of zippy
plot could prevent the book from being a disappointment.  Aldiss can
do better than this.<p>



<hr><a name="tehanuth"><h2>Tehanu: the Last Book of Earthsea (Ursula
Le Guin)</h2></a>

<h3>Gareth Rees</h3>

Readers might have seen Helen Steele's admirable review of
<cite>Tehanu</cite> in New Chronicles volume 17 number 2.  With luck,
this review will cover slightly different ground to Ms. Steele's, and
will contain some material of interest.<p>

Bearing a clever subtitle indicating firmly that Earthsea will not be
a gold mine for sequel&#173;hungry publishers, <cite>Tehanu</cite>
comes to us twenty years after <cite>A Wizard of Earthsea</cite> won
the Hornbook Prize and <cite>The Farthest Shore</cite> won the
National Book award in children's literature.  It is the work of a
more experienced, more mature writer, but it is not, I think, meant to
be a sequel in the conventional sense, but more of a commentary on the
earlier work.  If its concerns are different, this is because it
reflects the change in priorities and perceptions of its author.
<cite>Tehanu</cite> is filled with resonances to its ancestors:
characters from the earlier novels return - Ged, Tenar, Ogion,
Lebannen - but they are changed, or our perception of them has
changed.<p>

One major change that has taken place in Le Guin's writing between
<cite>The Farthest Shore</cite> and <cite>Tehanu</cite> is a
development of her feminist consciousness.  In her articles about her
early, un&#173;conscious&#173;raised fiction, there seems to be a
regret over the mistakes she made, but an unwillingness to revise old
work.  She regrets using the masculine pronoun to describe her
androgynes in <cite>The Left Hand of Darkness</cite> ("I dislike
invented pronouns less than the so&#173;called generic pronoun
he/him/his, which does in fact exclude women from discourse"), she
regrets her acceptance that men are leaders and doers and movers, and
I think she regrets her unthinking use of a male&#173;dominated
society in the Earthsea novels.  Early on in <cite>A Wizard of
Earthsea</cite>, we get:<p>

"There is a saying on Gont, Weak as woman's magic, and there is
another saying, Wicked as woman's magic.  Now the witch of Ten Alders
was no black sorceress, nor did she ever meddle with the high arts of
traffic with Old Powers; but being an ignorant woman among ignorant
folk, she often used her crafts to foolish and dubious ends.  She knew
nothing of the Balance and the Pattern which the true wizard knows and
serves... Much of her lore was rubbish and humbug, nor did she know
the true spells from the false."<p>

In Earthsea, men are wizards, wise and powerful, and women are
witches, ugly and ignorant.  Men are concerned with the great matters
of politics and wizardry, and women are shut out.  Only on Atuan do
women have power, and there the priestesses are ignorant followers of
a false religion, under the control of their king.  Terry Pratchett
was incensed enough by this to use Earthsea as the inspiration for his
<cite>Equal Rites</cite>.  How, Le Guin now wonders, could she have
been accepted this, been an unwitting collaborator in such misogyny?
<cite>Tehanu</cite> is suffused with a great anger; anger that women
can be treated like this, and worse, that they can collaborate in
their own marginalisation.  "I am often very angry, as a woman," she
has written, "My feminist anger is an element in, a part of, the rage
and fear that possess me when I face what we are all doing to each
other, to the earth, and to the hope of liberty and life."
<cite>Tehanu</cite> is, then, a chance to redeem the mistakes of
<cite>A Wizard of Earthsea</cite>, or (better) a chance to say the
things she didn't know how to say in the earlier books.<p>

Thus the protagonist is a woman, Tenar, ex&#173;priestess of Atuan,
the White Lady who had brought the ring of Erreth&#173;Akbe to Havnor.
She has married a farmer on Gont, and while Ged became Archmage and
saved the world, she has farmed the land, raised two children, and is
now a prosperous widow.  The background is one of growing evil and
lawlessness, the effect of Cob's opening of the door to the land of
the dead (in <cite>The Farthest Shore</cite>, which
<cite>Tehanu</cite> follows without a break).  Tenar's life is
disturbed when she rescues a child, Therru, who has been raped, thrown
into a fire and abandoned, and then by the arrival of Ged, borne on
the back of a dragon from his last triumph, weary and stripped of his
power.<p>

When compared with the previous Earthsea novels, the change in focus
is dramatic and complete.  <cite>Tehanu</cite> is concerned with
simple things, ordinary people trying to live ordinary lives in the
face of hardship and adversity.  Trying to live well, trying to
protect a child from harm, these are as important as, and as difficult
as saving the world.  This is the wisdom that Ged learns, not without
difficulty, from Tenar: how to be human as well as mage.
<cite>Tehanu</cite> is a mature book, though its philosophy seems at
times even more hopeless even than <cite>The Farthest Shore</cite>,
but in the end redemption and hope are offered.  This is Le Guin's
best novel yet.<p>



<hr><a name="bonefore"><h2>The Bone Forest (Robert Holdstock)</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

In this story collection Holdstock continues to develop the mythos
expounded in <cite>Mythago Wood</cite> and <cite>Lavondyss</cite>, a
deeper and darker, more primitive mythos than most contemporary
fantasists are willing to envisage.  Holdstock's myths are full of
shamanistic magic, of masks that take the wearer into a spirit world,
of cave&#173;painting, or the relationship between humans and the
beautiful and terrible power of nature incarnate, and hints of the
struggle to survive during the Ice Age: a particularly North European
mythos.<p>

The title novella is the third of the author's Mythago stories, and
even at the shorter length the fascinating power of the wildwood and
the obsession of the characters enter it are powerfully done.<p>

I do fear that if Holdstock continues to add to this series, he will
eventually produce a story that is a lifeless imitation of his
previous successes.  But `The Bone Forest' is not that story.<p>

The other stories in the collection are stories of the mythos itself,
signposts in Holdstock's quest for the ur&#173;myth of the collective
unconscious, with one exception, `The Time Beyond Age'.  This last is
a chilling story of the dehumanising potential of science, and of the
obsession of a scientist who has lost his way.<p>



<hr><a name="secretha"><h2>Secret Harmonies (Paul J McAuley)</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

Paul McAuley is one of the emerging `generation' of young British sf
authors who have been nurtured in the pages of <cite>Interzone</cite>
(Ian Lee and Greg Egan are other names to watch out for).  His first
novel, <cite>Four Hundred Billion Stars</cite>, was lauded in the
magazines at the time, and won the Philip K Dick award, but I cannot
recall any comment on this, the author's second novel.<p>

The reason for this is evident on reading: <cite>Secret
Harmonies</cite> is a competent work of hard sf ("In the great
tradition of Arthur C Clarke and Bob Shaw," exudes the blurb), but
lacks any spark of brilliance that would make it stand out from the
myriad of other competent hard sf novels.<p>

The background is a few hundred years hence.  Elysium is an
earth&#173;like planet populated by `aborigines', primitive
tool&#173;using aliens whose sentience is doubtful and with whom
meaningful contact has been impossible; there is resentment between
the original colonists who rule the planet tyrannically, and the later
settlers from Earth; there is a super&#173;intelligent computer with
obscure motivations and abilities.  When the expected spaceship from
Earth fails to arrive, these tensions erupt into planet&#173;wide
war.<p>

The background is nicely done, with convincing details of technology,
and the oppression of the computer&#173;assisted police state is a
well&#173;portrayed ominous presence, but the plot elements completely
fail to come together to make any kind of coherent whole.  The lack of
cohesion is not helped by the rather drab set of characters, who seem
to wander purposelessly through the predictable plot.  The novel
follows the fortunes of two men: Miguel Lucas (many of the names
suggest Latin American roots, but there is no sense of a Latin culture
(in fact Elysium is supposed to have been settled by Australians, and
there is no suggestion of Australian culture either)) is a settler who
has `gone dingo', living outside the repressive laws, and shows
promise, but his mind gets taken over by the computer at an early
stage in the plot.  Richard Florey, a university lecturer, wavers
between loyalty to the state and support for the rebels, and his love
affairs are peculiarly passionless.<p>

<cite>Secret Harmonies</cite> is disappointing precisely because it
lacks passion and conviction, in the background, the plot, and
especially the characters.  Nor is the choice of title ever explained
(in the US it was published as <cite>Of the Fall</cite>, which is
almost equally inappropriate).<p>



<hr><a name="cityoftr"><h2>City of Truth (James Morrow)</h2></a>

<H3>Gareth Rees</H3>

Veritas is the City of Truth, and its citizens are `brainburned' early
in adolescence to make them incapable of telling a lie.  Worse than
that - the treatment produces a compulsion to tell the whole truth -
no lying by omission.<p>

This is a wonderful background for comedy, and Morrow takes full
advantage.  The narrator, Jack Sperry, drinks `Donaldson's Drinkable
Coffee', eats `Murdered cow sandwich' at the `No Great Shakes'
restaurant, and on meeting a female writer:<p>

"`I'd like to read some of your doggerel,' I asserted.  `And I'd like
to have sex with you,' I added, wincing at my candour.  It wasn't easy
being a citizen."<p>

The book takes on a serious tone when Sperry's son contracts an
incurable cancer, and Sperry becomes convinced that his son can be
saved only if he can be convinced that he is sure to get better, thus
invoking the healing power of his immune system.  But how can Sperry
learn to lie, when lying is not only forbidden but impossible?<p>

Comparing <cite>City of Truth</cite> to Morrow's earlier <cite>This is
the Way the World Ends</cite> and <cite>The Continent of Lies</cite>,
it seems that Morrow's essential theme is a father's terrible struggle
to keep his child from harm.<p>

I thought this an excellent book, at 104 pages just the right length
for the story.  The portrait of the terribly bleak society of Veritas
(deprived of art, decoration, privacy, humour and other `lies') is
both funny and telling, as is the mechanism by which Sperry learns to
lie.<p>

One final point.  I like the novella format - an excellent antidote to
the idea that good books must be long - and I also liked
Century/Legend's earlier novellas <cite>Heads</cite> (Greg Bear) and
<cite>Ruins</cite> (Brian Aldiss).  But is 4 pounds 99 pence really
worth it for 104 pages?<p>



<hr><a name="wisechil"><h2>Wise Children (Angela Carter)</h2></a>

<H3>Helen Steele</H3>

<cite>Wise Children</cite> is the most recent (and possibly the last)
of Angela Carter's `mainstream' novels.  Narrated by Dora Chance, one
of the illegitimate twin chorus girls, the Lucky Chances, it traces
their life from Brixton to Hollywood and back again, and the life of
their family through seventy five years - culminating in the amazing
one hundredth birthday of their real father, Sir Melchior Hazard -
head of the `Royal Family of the Theatre'.<p>

The story itself is both wonderfully constructed and told.  Though
often bordering on the absurd, its vivid, well&#173;paced and
well&#173;judged narration ultimately makes it believable.  However
Carter does not give us an easy ride - rather a rollercoaster of
emotions: black humour, pleasant reminiscence giving way to the sharp
shock of the terrible, or the exhilaration of the unexpected. She
shows us peoples lives and she makes us believe - we can see the
people growing and changing, interacting within the framework of the
family, learning to accept past mistakes, and present circumstance,
beginning to know themselves - becoming wise children.<p>

Indeed it is the portrayal of the characters within the book that
provides its force - many of them are larger than life - Sir Melchior
Hazard, Uncle Perry, Grandma, `Wheelchair', and the ghastly twins,
Saskia and Imogen - and some of them are thoughtless, selfish, petty
and greedy - yet ultimately, through the writing we can at least
understand them and perhaps even sympathise.  Most important of all we
see then through the unflinching eyes of an old woman and it is the
characters of the twins, the Wise Children, Dora and Nora that Carter
writes best - through the length of the book we can always believe in
them, and their (not always blameless) lives.<p>

<cite>Wise Children</cite> is a fine book, and is
thought&#173;provoking as well as entertaining.  A well
thought&#173;out story, captivating characters, the convincing
backdrop and the message behind it make <cite>Wise Children</cite>
thoroughly recommended.<p>

<strong>Editors' note</strong>: Angela Carter died on February 16th,
1992.  A great loss to literature.<p>

<hr><a name="nelsonsc"><h2>Nelson's Column: The Molesworth
Mythago</h2></a>

<H3>Huw Walters</H3>

The mythagos cluster at the edges of my vision.  I glimpsed the
Molesworth form this morning, at the woodland edge.  He had a packet
of cigs, and seemed to be hiding from something.  Why won't he appear
in the fore&#173;vision?  Alas, I am too old.  The equipment helps,
but it's so hard to get the lubricant these days.  Perhaps someone
younger - but I dread the thought.  I think Jennifer suspects
something, but it's hard to tell.  I wish I could explain it to her!
Wynne Jones arrives tomorrow.<p>

Today's training with Wynne Jones: test pattern 37: ii, LSD trip, pink
neon environment.  The flow was the most powerful I have ever known;
I've started seeing little green mythagos, and it's really weird.  J
is getting worried.  I dread to think what she'd do if she found any
of the equipment.<p>

Molesworth is back, and he's getting bolder.  I tracked him to the
hogback glade, but he threw an old bungy and a protractor at me.  This
is becoming alarming!<p>

The mythagos are generated from the primal woodland, by the combined
emotions of a whole generation.  Just as Hood was created to help the
Saxons against the Normans, and Arthur helped the Britons against the
Saxons before him, I think the Molesworth form (so long dormant!) is
emerging once more to defend the new generation.  Wynne Jones thinks
he may pre&#173;date the neolithic; I'm not so sure, but he does have
a face like a squished tomato.  The earliest reference I can find is
from 1576; could he be Kurdling's "ignorant lout"?<p>

The boys glimpsed Molesworth by the mill&#173;point yesterday; they
said he was trying to convert the old rowing boat into a spaceship.
Christian was more rational about it, but I hope they will both
associate what they have seen with one of the locals: the Grimley
village idiot perhaps.  In any case, I have invented stories for them,
and told them not to go off with strange men.<p>

Molesworth came into my study today.  I watched him emerge from the
woodland, this time accompanied by a low beast, of feral and manky
appearance.  It appeared to have a deflated football between its jaws,
which it chewed occasionally.  Molesworth explored my study with the
curiosity of a child.  W J believes his mind (so close to that of its
creator) may be receptive to education, but I find it difficult to
communicate with him.  He seemed especially fascinated with my desk,
and carved some railway sidings on the top.  Also, was fixed to my
chair when I saw him; he seems to be using glue of some sort.  J came
into my study, and became hysterical.  She probably thinks I've
started fancying boys again.<p>

Have learned to communicate with Molesworth!  He painted himself green
(in homage to the Pukon?) and told me the story of how he came to
Ryhope.  It seems he was on a botany walk, and got separated from the
crocodile, chiz chiz chiz...<p>

Snorri was trying to break Caxton out of the giant metal egg.<p>

"Will it be alright?" asked Caxton nervously.<p>

Snorri picked up the hammer morosely.  He held its head in his two
hands for a moment, examining it for cracks as though it were the
hammer which would break on the egg and not the other way around.  "We
don't want to hurt me, you know," said Caxton, and gave a little laugh
as if the idea was impossible anyway, so hardly worth warning
against.<p>

"I don't want to hurt you," said Snorri.<p>

"Because, after all, ha ha, I mean, you might as well leave me in the
egg, rather than break me to pieces getting me out, eh?  I'd rather be
immobile in an egg than a hospital bed."<p>

"This isn't going to hurt you," said Snorri, and he hefted up the
hammer to strike.  "Perhaps we'd better call it off," said Caxton with
urgency, but it was too late, Snorri couldn't hold the hammer up any
longer and down it fell to clang and shiver on the impenentrable egg.
Snorri dragged it to the ground and looked at the sheer surface.<p>

"You aren't very strong, are you?" said Caxton.<p>

"No," said Snorri.  He lifted it to try again.<p>

"Put some vim into it this time," said Caxton.  "I couldn't even feel
that last one rattle my bones."  Snorri let the hammerhead have its
own way and down it smashed again with no more effect than the last
time.  His hands ached with vibration.<p>

"Don't think I'm not grateful, you know, but if this goes on I might
as well wait to be hatched or something."<p>

Snorri said nothing.  He wasn't having a good day.<p>
